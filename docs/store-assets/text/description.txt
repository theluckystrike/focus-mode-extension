Distractions cost the average knowledge worker $608 per week in lost productivity. Every time you check social media or fall down a news rabbit hole, it takes 23 minutes to fully refocus. That's not a habit problem — it's an environment problem.

Block distractions. Build focus. Track your streak.

Focus Mode - Blocker is a free Chrome extension that combines website blocking, gamification, and a built-in Pomodoro timer to help you take back your attention.


WHY FOCUS MODE - BLOCKER?

Most blockers give you a list and a toggle. We give you a system.

  - 10 free sites to block — 3x more than competing extensions. Add your worst distractions from day one without hitting a paywall.

  - Gamification meets strong blocking — Focus Score, daily streaks, and the Nuclear Option. No other blocker combines habit-building mechanics with serious distraction defense.

  - Privacy-first, always — Your data never leaves your device. No accounts. No analytics. No tracking. Works entirely offline.


FEATURES

  Smart Website Blocking — Block distracting sites with one click. 10 sites free, plus pre-built lists for social media and news so you can get started in seconds.

  Focus Score (0-100) — A unique productivity metric that measures how focused you actually are. Watch your score climb as you build better habits.

  Pomodoro Timer — Built-in 25/5 timer keeps you in the zone with structured focus sessions. Start a session and let the timer do the rest.

  Streak Tracking — Build daily focus streaks and watch your consistency grow. Don't break the chain.

  Nuclear Option — Lock yourself out of distractions for up to 1 hour (24 hours with Pro). No undo. No workarounds. When you need serious focus, this is it.

  Motivational Block Page — Every blocked page shows your current stats, streaks, and an encouraging quote to keep you on track instead of showing a dead end.

  Ambient Sounds — 3 free focus sounds (rain, cafe, white noise) to help you enter and stay in flow state.

  Schedule Blocking — Set automatic focus schedules for work hours. Your blocklist activates on its own so you never forget to turn it on.
