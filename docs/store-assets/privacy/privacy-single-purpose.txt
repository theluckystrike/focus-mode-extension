Focus Mode - Blocker serves a single purpose: helping users block distracting websites and build focused work habits.

Specifically, this extension:
- Blocks access to user-specified distracting websites using Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API
- Provides a built-in Pomodoro timer for structured focus sessions
- Tracks focus statistics (Focus Score, streaks, session history) locally on the user's device
- Does NOT collect, transmit, or store any user data on external servers

All processing happens locally in your browser. No data is collected, transmitted, or stored on external servers. Your browsing data and focus statistics never leave your device.

The extension requires 8 permissions to function:
- storage: Saves your blocklist, settings, and focus statistics locally
- alarms: Powers the Pomodoro timer and scheduled blocking
- declarativeNetRequest: Blocks distracting websites via Chrome's built-in API
- declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess: Applies blocking rules to websites you specify
- activeTab: Detects the current website to check against your blocklist
- scripting: Injects the motivational block page when a site is blocked
- notifications: Sends alerts when focus sessions end
- offscreen: Plays ambient focus sounds in the background

These permissions are the minimum necessary for the extension's stated purpose.
