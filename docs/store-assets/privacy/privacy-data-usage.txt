FOCUS MODE - BLOCKER: DATA USAGE DECLARATION
Chrome Web Store Privacy Tab — Data Usage Section
================================================================================

This document specifies the data usage declarations for the Chrome Web Store
submission. Focus Mode - Blocker does NOT collect or transmit any user data
to external servers. All data is stored locally on the user's device via
chrome.storage.local.

================================================================================
DATA USAGE CATEGORIES (All 9 Categories: NOT COLLECTED)
================================================================================

1. Personally identifiable information
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect names, addresses, email addresses, age,
   identification numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.

2. Health information
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect any health-related data.

3. Financial and payment information
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect credit card numbers, bank account numbers,
   or any financial data. Pro license verification (if applicable) is handled
   entirely through Chrome Web Store's payment infrastructure.

4. Authentication information
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect passwords, credentials, security questions,
   or personal identification numbers. The optional identity permission (Pro
   tier only) uses Chrome's built-in OAuth flow and does not expose or store
   authentication credentials.

5. Personal communications
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect emails, text messages, chat logs, or any
   personal communications.

6. Location
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect or access geographic location data of any
   kind (fine or coarse).

7. Web history
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect, record, or transmit any browsing history.
   While the extension checks the active tab URL against the user's blocklist,
   this comparison happens locally in real-time and no URL history is recorded
   or transmitted. The locally-stored sessionHistory tracks only focus session
   durations and scores, not URLs visited.

8. User activity
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect network monitoring data, clicks, mouse
   position, scroll data, or keystroke logging. Focus statistics (Focus Score,
   streaks) are computed locally and never transmitted.

9. Website content
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect or read any website content. Content scripts
   only inject the block page overlay on user-specified blocked sites and do
   not extract any page content.


================================================================================
LOCAL STORAGE DISCLOSURE
================================================================================

While no data is collected or transmitted externally, the extension does store
the following data LOCALLY on the user's device via chrome.storage.local:

  - blocklist: User-specified list of websites to block during focus sessions
  - settings: User preferences (timer durations, theme, notification settings)
  - focusScore: Numerical score (0-100) reflecting recent focus consistency
  - streakData: Current and historical focus streak information
  - sessionHistory: Record of focus session durations and completion status
  - timerState: Current Pomodoro timer state for session persistence
  - soundPreferences: Selected ambient sounds and volume settings
  - schedules: User-configured automatic blocking schedules
  - proLicense: Pro tier license status (boolean)

NONE of this locally-stored data is transmitted to external servers, shared
with third parties, or used for any purpose other than providing the
extension's core functionality to the user.


================================================================================
CERTIFICATIONS (All 3 Checked)
================================================================================

[x] I certify that the extension does not sell user data to third parties,
    outside of the approved use cases as described in the Chrome Web Store
    Developer Program Policies.

[x] I certify that the extension does not use or transfer user data for
    purposes that are unrelated to the item's single purpose.

[x] I certify that the extension does not use or transfer user data to
    determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.
