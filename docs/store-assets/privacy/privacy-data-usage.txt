FOCUS MODE - BLOCKER: DATA USAGE DECLARATION
Chrome Web Store Privacy Tab — Data Usage Section
================================================================================

This document specifies the data usage declarations for the Chrome Web Store
submission. Focus Mode - Blocker transmits limited data to the Zovo API
(https://xggdjlurppfcytxqoozs.supabase.co/functions/v1) for license
verification and anonymous analytics tracking. All user-generated content
(settings, blocked sites, focus stats) is stored locally on the user's device.

NETWORK REQUESTS MADE:
  - /verify-extension-license — License key validation (Pro tier only)
  - /track-event — Anonymous analytics events

DATA THAT IS TRANSMITTED:
  - License key, extension ID (for license verification)
  - Email address associated with the license (returned from server)
  - Event name, extension ID, session ID, timestamp, version (for analytics)

DATA THAT IS NOT TRANSMITTED:
  - Browsing history or URLs visited
  - Blocked site lists or whitelist rules
  - Focus session statistics, scores, or streaks
  - Personal data (name, location, communications)
  - Any website content

================================================================================
DATA USAGE CATEGORIES
================================================================================

1. Personally identifiable information
   Collection: COLLECTED (limited)
   Usage: The email address associated with a Pro license key is received from
   the Zovo API during license verification and displayed in the Account tab.
   This email is not collected by the extension itself — it is returned by the
   server as part of the license response. It is stored locally and not
   transmitted elsewhere. No names, addresses, age, or identification numbers
   are collected.

2. Health information
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect any health-related data.

3. Financial and payment information
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect credit card numbers, bank account numbers,
   or any financial data. License keys are purchased externally and entered
   by the user. No payment processing occurs within the extension.

4. Authentication information
   Collection: COLLECTED (limited)
   Usage: The user's Pro license key is stored in chrome.storage.sync and
   transmitted to the Zovo API for verification. This is not a password or
   credential — it is a product license key. No passwords, security questions,
   or personal identification numbers are collected.

5. Personal communications
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect emails, text messages, chat logs, or any
   personal communications.

6. Location
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect or access geographic location data of any
   kind (fine or coarse).

7. Web history
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect, record, or transmit any browsing history.
   While the extension checks the active tab URL against the user's blocklist,
   this comparison happens locally in real-time and no URL history is recorded
   or transmitted. The locally-stored sessionHistory tracks only focus session
   durations and scores, not URLs visited. Analytics events do NOT include
   any URLs or browsing data.

8. User activity
   Collection: COLLECTED (limited)
   Usage: Anonymous analytics events are sent to the Zovo API. Each event
   contains: event name, extension ID, session ID (random, not tied to user
   identity), timestamp, and extension version. No clicks, mouse positions,
   scroll data, or keystroke data is collected. Focus statistics (Focus Score,
   streaks) are computed locally and never transmitted.

9. Website content
   Collection: NOT COLLECTED
   The extension does not collect or read any website content. Content scripts
   only inject the block page overlay on user-specified blocked sites and do
   not extract any page content.


================================================================================
LOCAL STORAGE DISCLOSURE
================================================================================

The extension stores data locally on the user's device using Chrome's storage
APIs:

  chrome.storage.local (device only):
  - blocklist: User-specified list of websites to block during focus sessions
  - settings: User preferences (timer durations, theme, notification settings)
  - focusScore: Numerical score (0-100) reflecting recent focus consistency
  - streakData: Current and historical focus streak information
  - sessionHistory: Record of focus session durations and completion status
  - timerState: Current Pomodoro timer state for session persistence
  - soundPreferences: Selected ambient sounds and volume settings
  - schedules: User-configured automatic blocking schedules
  - licenseCache: Cached license validation result (to reduce API calls)
  - analyticsQueue: Queued analytics events awaiting network connectivity

  chrome.storage.sync (synced across signed-in Chrome devices):
  - licenseKey: The user's Pro license key

The blocklist, settings, focus statistics, and session data are NEVER
transmitted to external servers. Only the license key and anonymous analytics
events (described above) are transmitted to the Zovo API.


================================================================================

SUMMARY
================================================================================

Focus Mode - Blocker is a privacy-first extension. It:

  - Makes network requests ONLY to the Zovo API for license verification
    and anonymous analytics — no other external connections
  - Stores all user-generated data (blocklists, settings, focus stats)
    exclusively on the local device
  - Never transmits browsing history, blocked site lists, focus statistics,
    or personal information to any external server
  - Does not use third-party analytics services, telemetry, or crash reporting
  - Does not contain ads or integrate with advertising networks
  - Does not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties
  - Analytics events contain only: event name, extension ID, session ID,
    timestamp, and version — no personally identifiable information

Users can verify this by:
  1. Inspecting the source code: https://github.com/theluckystrike/focus-mode-blocker
  2. Monitoring network traffic (only requests to xggdjlurppfcytxqoozs.supabase.co)
  3. Reviewing chrome.storage.local and chrome.storage.sync via Chrome DevTools
