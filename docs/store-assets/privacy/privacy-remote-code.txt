This extension does not use remote code.

All JavaScript code is bundled within the extension package and reviewed during
Chrome Web Store submission. The extension does not:

- Load external scripts via <script> tags, import(), or fetch()
- Use eval(), new Function(), or any form of dynamic code execution
- Fetch code from external servers at runtime
- Execute any remotely-hosted JavaScript, WebAssembly, or other executable code
- Use innerHTML or DOM manipulation to inject executable code from external sources
- Load external stylesheets that could contain executable content

The Content Security Policy enforces:
  script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';

This CSP ensures that only scripts included in the extension package can execute.
No inline scripts, no remote scripts, and no plugin-based code execution is
permitted.

All content scripts (detector.js, blocker.js, tracker.js) are:
- Bundled within the extension .crx package
- Listed explicitly in the manifest.json
- Reviewed as part of the Chrome Web Store submission process
- Available for public audit in the source repository

The service worker (background.js) is:
- Bundled within the extension package
- Registered in the manifest.json
- Contains no dynamic code loading or execution

The popup and options pages:
- Use only locally-bundled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Do not load any external resources (fonts, scripts, stylesheets, images)
- All assets are included in the extension package
