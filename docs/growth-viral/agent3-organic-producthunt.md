Title: I built a Chrome extension that gamifies blocking distracting
       websites — here's what I learned

---

Hey everyone,

After months of procrastinating on Reddit (ironic, I know), I finally
shipped Focus Mode - Blocker, a Chrome extension that blocks distracting
websites with a twist: it turns focus into a game.

**The problem I was solving:**
I tried every website blocker out there. They all worked for about 3 days
before I'd just disable them. The problem wasn't the blocking — it was
motivation. I needed a reason to KEEP blocking.

**What makes Focus Mode different:**

- **Focus Score (0-100):** A daily score based on how well you stayed
  focused. It drops when you try to visit blocked sites and rises when
  you complete focus sessions. Watching the number climb is addictive
  in the right way.

- **Streak System:** Like Duolingo for focus. Miss a day and your streak
  resets. I'm at 47 days right now and I refuse to break it.

- **Nuclear Mode:** When you REALLY need to focus, Nuclear Mode locks
  your blocklist so you literally cannot turn it off until the timer
  expires. I use this during deep work blocks.

- **Pomodoro Integration:** Built-in 25/5 timer that auto-activates
  blocking during focus periods.

- **Ambient Sounds:** Lo-fi, rain, forest sounds built right into the
  extension.

- **Privacy-First:** On the free plan, zero data leaves your browser.
  No analytics, no tracking, nothing.

**Some numbers after [X] weeks:**
- [X] users installed
- [X] Chrome Web Store rating
- Free plan: 10 blocked sites
- Pro: $4.99/mo for unlimited everything

**What I learned building this:**
1. Manifest V3 is painful but doable
2. Gamification is incredibly powerful for habit tools
3. Privacy-first isn't just ethical — it's a competitive advantage
4. The hardest part isn't building, it's marketing

Happy to answer any questions about the tech, the business model,
or the focus techniques behind it.

### Template 2: Value-Add Comment for r/productivity

```
Context: Responding to "How do you actually stay focused while
working from home?"

---

What worked for me after trying everything:

1. **Environment design** — I removed my phone from my desk entirely.
   Sounds simple but it eliminated 60% of distractions.

2. **Website blocking** — I use a Chrome extension that blocks my
   worst time-sinks (Reddit, Twitter, YouTube) during work hours.
   The key was finding one with a "nuclear mode" that I literally
   cannot disable during focus blocks.

3. **Pomodoro with accountability** — 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off.
   But instead of just using a timer, I track a "focus score" that
   gamifies the whole thing. Watching my score drop when I try to
   sneak onto Reddit is surprisingly effective motivation.

4. **Streaks** — I've built a 47-day focus streak and the fear of
   breaking it keeps me more disciplined than any productivity
   book ever did.

5. **Ambient sounds** — Brown noise or rain sounds. There's actual
   research showing it helps with sustained attention.

The biggest mindset shift: stop trying to have more willpower.
Instead, make distraction harder and focus easier. Design the
system so the default behavior is productive.
```

### Template 3: Problem Thread Response for r/ADHD

```
Context: Responding to "I can't stop checking social media even
when I know I should be working"

---

I deal with this too and here's what actually helped (not just
"try harder" advice):

**The core problem isn't willpower — it's that these sites are
designed by teams of engineers to hijack your attention.** You're
not failing; you're fighting a machine.

What worked for me:

- **Physical barriers first:** Phone goes in another room. Period.
  Not face-down on the desk. Another room.

- **Browser blocking:** I use a website blocker on Chrome that
  locks out my trigger sites. The important thing is finding one
  where you can't just easily disable it in the moment. I need
  something with a timer lock because I will absolutely rationalize
  "just 5 minutes" otherwise.

- **Replace the behavior:** When I feel the urge to check Twitter,
  I switch to a 2-minute breathing exercise instead. The urge
  passes in about 90 seconds.

- **Gamify it:** My blocker tracks a daily "focus score" and
  honestly, the game-like element appeals to my ADHD brain in a
  way that pure discipline never could. I actually WANT to keep
  the score high.

- **Forgive yourself:** Bad days happen. The goal isn't perfection.
  It's building a system that makes the average day better.

You're not broken. You just need better tools and systems.

Title: [Method] The "Focus Score" method — how I gamified my way
       out of internet addiction

---

[NeedAdvice] posts about screen time and internet distractions
come up here constantly, so I wanted to share a system that
actually stuck for me after years of trying.

**The Core Idea: Make Focus a Game, Not a Chore**

Instead of trying to white-knuckle my way through not checking
Reddit/Twitter/YouTube, I turned it into a daily score.

Here's the system:

**Step 1: Identify Your Top 5 Distraction Sites**
Check your browser history. Be honest. Mine were:
- Reddit
- Twitter/X
- YouTube
- Hacker News
- Instagram

**Step 2: Block Them During Work Hours**
Use any website blocker. The key features to look for:
- Timer lock (so you can't disable it impulsively)
- Scheduled blocking (auto-activates during work hours)

**Step 3: Track Your "Focus Score" Daily**
Rate yourself 0-100 each day based on:
- Did you complete your planned focus sessions? (+20)
- Did you avoid blocked sites during work hours? (+30)
- Did you complete at least 4 Pomodoro cycles? (+20)
- Did you maintain your streak? (+10)
- Were you present and engaged in your work? (+20)

**Step 4: Build a Streak**
Mark each day you score 60+ on a calendar. The visual chain
of successful days becomes its own motivation. (Yes, this is
the Seinfeld "don't break the chain" method applied to focus.)

**Step 5: Add Ambient Sounds**
This was a game-changer for me. Brown noise or rain sounds
during focus sessions. Research supports this — consistent
background noise reduces the novelty-seeking that drives
distraction.

**Results after 60 days:**
- Average focus sessions per day: 2.1 → 5.4
- Estimated productive hours: 3-4 → 6-7
- Social media screen time: 3.5 hrs → 45 min
- Streak: 47 days and counting

The key insight is that gamification works because it gives
your brain the dopamine hit it's seeking, but from productive
behavior instead of scrolling.

Happy to elaborate on any part of this. It genuinely changed
my work life.

Title: Show HN: Focus Mode - Blocker – Chrome extension with
       Focus Score gamification and Nuclear Mode

---

Hi HN,

I built Focus Mode - Blocker, a Chrome extension (Manifest V3)
that blocks distracting websites with a few twists:

1. Focus Score (0-100) that gamifies staying focused throughout
   your day

2. Nuclear Mode that timer-locks your blocklist so you literally
   can't bypass it

3. Built-in Pomodoro timer (25/5) that auto-activates blocking

4. Streak system for building daily habits

5. Ambient sounds (lo-fi, rain, forest, etc.)

6. Privacy-first: on free plan, zero network requests — all data
   stays local in chrome.storage.local

The free tier gives you 10 blocked sites. Pro ($4.99/mo or $49.99
lifetime) unlocks unlimited sites, Nuclear Mode, ambient sounds,
and more.

Tech: Manifest V3 service worker, content scripts, chrome.storage
API, Web Audio API for sounds.

Some things I learned building this:

- MV3 service workers are finicky about lifecycle management.
  They can be killed at any time, which makes timers unreliable.
  I solved this with chrome.alarms API.

- Building a gamification system that's motivating without being
  annoying is surprisingly hard. The Focus Score algorithm went
  through 12 iterations.

- "Unbypassable" blocking in a browser extension is inherently
  limited (user can always uninstall), so Nuclear Mode uses
  friction design — making it very inconvenient to bypass rather
  than truly impossible.

### HN Engagement Rules

```
HACKER NEWS ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY
=================================

Timing:
  - Post between 8-10 AM ET on Tuesday/Wednesday
  - Avoid weekends, Fridays, and Mondays
  - Avoid days when major tech news drops

Response Strategy:
  - Reply to EVERY comment within 2 hours
  - Be technical and honest
  - Acknowledge limitations openly
  - Share technical details generously
  - Never be defensive about criticism

Expected Questions & Prepared Answers:

Q: "Can't users just uninstall the extension?"
A: "Yes, and that's by design. Nuclear Mode adds friction, not
   force. The goal is to make the impulsive override hard enough
   that your rational brain has time to catch up. We're not
   building a prison — we're building a speed bump for your
   impulses."

Q: "Why not open source?"
A: "Parts of the codebase are open source [link to GitHub].
   The core blocking logic is MIT licensed. The gamification
   and premium features are proprietary to sustain development."

Q: "How is this different from LeechBlock/uBlock/hosts file?"
A: "Those tools block effectively but don't address motivation.
   Focus Mode adds gamification (Focus Score, streaks) and
   integrated productivity tools (Pomodoro, ambient sounds)
   that make blocking sustainable long-term. Pure blocking
   tools have a 3-week average abandonment rate."

Q: "What about privacy? Extensions can see everything."
A: "On free plan: zero external requests. No analytics, no
   telemetry, nothing. You can verify in DevTools Network tab.
   Pro sync uses encrypted storage. We're building trust by
   making our privacy claims verifiable."

Q: "MV3 service workers must be fun."
A: "They're challenging. Service workers can terminate at any
   time, so we use chrome.alarms for all timing, persist state
   to storage frequently, and handle cold starts gracefully.
   Happy to go deeper on any specific MV3 pain point."

### Example Stack Overflow Answers (Focus Mode Relevant)

#### Answer: "How to implement a timer in Manifest V3 Chrome extension?"

```markdown
**Short answer:** Use `chrome.alarms` instead of `setInterval` because
MV3 service workers can terminate at any time.

Here's a working implementation:

```javascript
// background.js (service worker)

// Create a recurring alarm
chrome.alarms.create('pomodoroTick', {
  delayInMinutes: 0.5, // 30 seconds
  periodInMinutes: 0.5
});

// Listen for alarm
chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  if (alarm.name === 'pomodoroTick') {
    updateTimer();
  }
});

async function updateTimer() {
  const { timerState } = await chrome.storage.local.get('timerState');
  if (!timerState || !timerState.isRunning) return;

  const elapsed = Date.now() - timerState.startTime;
  const remaining = timerState.duration - elapsed;

  if (remaining <= 0) {
    // Timer complete
    await chrome.storage.local.set({
      timerState: { ...timerState, isRunning: false, completed: true }
    });
    chrome.notifications.create({
      type: 'basic',
      iconUrl: 'icon128.png',
      title: 'Focus Session Complete!',
      message: 'Great work! Time for a break.'
    });
  }
}
```

**Why `chrome.alarms` instead of `setInterval`:**

In Manifest V3, the background runs as a service worker that Chrome
can terminate after ~30 seconds of inactivity. `setInterval` timers
die when the service worker terminates. `chrome.alarms` persists
across service worker restarts because Chrome manages the alarm
independently.

**Gotchas:**
- Minimum alarm interval is 30 seconds in production (1 minute in
  older Chrome versions)
- Always persist timer state to `chrome.storage.local` so you can
  resume after service worker restart
- Use `Date.now()` offsets instead of counting intervals for accuracy

I ran into all of these building a Pomodoro timer for a Chrome
extension. The state persistence pattern above is battle-tested.
```

## The Problem

MV3 service workers can be terminated by Chrome at any time. This
breaks `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, and any in-memory timer state.

## The Solution

This library provides battle-tested timer patterns using
`chrome.alarms` with automatic state persistence to
`chrome.storage.local`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install mv3-timer-patterns
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import { PomodoroTimer } from 'mv3-timer-patterns';

const timer = new PomodoroTimer({
  focusDuration: 25,  // minutes
  breakDuration: 5,   // minutes
  onComplete: (type) => {
    console.log(`${type} session complete!`);
  }
});

await timer.start();
```

## Patterns Included

- **PomodoroTimer** — Full Pomodoro cycle management
- **CountdownTimer** — Simple countdown with persistence
- **ScheduledTask** — Cron-like scheduling for extensions
- **ServiceWorkerKeepAlive** — Heartbeat pattern (use sparingly)

## Used By

- [Focus Mode - Blocker](https://focusmodeblocker.com) — Chrome
  extension for blocking distracting websites with Focus Score
  gamification

  - Three distinct personas show breadth of appeal
  - Testimonial cards feel authentic (first names, roles)
  - Trust metrics at bottom reinforce credibility
  - Lighter background contrasts with darker feature images

## 4.7 ProductHunt Community Engagement (4 Weeks Before Launch)

### Daily Engagement Routine

```
PH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT — DAILY ROUTINE
==========================================

Time Required: 20-30 minutes per day

Morning (10 minutes):
  1. Browse PH homepage
  2. Upvote 3-5 products you genuinely find interesting
  3. Leave 1-2 thoughtful comments on trending products
  4. Reply to any comments on your own activity

Afternoon (10 minutes):
  1. Check PH Discussions section
  2. Participate in 1 discussion thread
  3. Follow 5 new makers in your space
  4. Engage with makers you've followed previously

Comment Quality Standards:
  - NEVER write "Great product!" or "Love this!"
  - Ask a specific question about the product
  - Share how you'd use it in your workflow
  - Offer a genuine suggestion or feature idea
  - Connect it to your own experience building Focus Mode
  - Minimum 2-3 sentences per comment

Example High-Quality PH Comment:
  "Really interesting approach to the scheduling problem. I've been
   building a focus/productivity Chrome extension and one thing I've
   learned is that the scheduling UX is make-or-break — if it takes
   more than 10 seconds to set up, users won't bother. How did you
   handle recurring schedules? That was our biggest design challenge."
```

## 4.8 First Maker Comment Draft

entire conversation thread on the PH page.

### Complete Maker Comment (Ready to Post)

```
Hey ProductHunt! 👋

I'm [Name], the maker behind Focus Mode - Blocker, and I'm
thrilled to finally share this with the PH community.

**The backstory:**
I built Focus Mode because every website blocker I tried had the
same problem — I'd use it for a week, then disable it and go back
to doomscrolling. The blocking worked fine. The *motivation* to
keep blocking didn't.

So I asked: what if blocking websites felt less like punishment
and more like a game?

**What makes Focus Mode different:**

🎯 **Focus Score (0-100)** — A daily score that tracks how well
you stayed focused. It goes up when you complete focus sessions
and down when you try to visit blocked sites. Watching the number
climb is genuinely addictive (in the good way).

🔥 **Streak System** — Like Duolingo for focus. I'm at [X] days
and I refuse to break it.

☢️ **Nuclear Mode** — Timer-locks your blocklist so you literally
cannot turn it off. For when you need to go full monk mode.

🍅 **Pomodoro Timer** — Built-in 25/5 timer with auto-blocking
during focus sessions.

🎵 **Ambient Sounds** — Rain, lo-fi, forest, cafe sounds right
in the extension.

🔒 **Privacy-First** — On free plan, ZERO data leaves your
browser. No analytics, no tracking, nothing. You can verify in
DevTools.

**Pricing:**
- Free: 10 blocked sites, Pomodoro, Focus Score, streaks
- Pro: $4.99/mo (or $2.99/mo annual) for unlimited everything
- Lifetime: $49.99 one-time
- Team: $3.99/user/mo

**Special for PH:**
🎁 Use code PRODUCTHUNT30 for 30% off any Pro plan (valid for
48 hours after launch).

I'd love to hear your feedback, answer any questions, and learn
how you handle digital distractions. What's your #1 distraction
site? (Mine was Reddit, which is ironic given where I'm posting
this 😄)

Thanks for checking us out!

## 5.2 First Maker Comment — Ready to Post

See Section 4.8 for the complete first maker comment draft. Post this IMMEDIATELY at 12:00 AM PT.

### Follow-Up Maker Comments (Throughout the Day)

**2-Hour Update Comment:**
```
Quick update — we just hit [X] upvotes and I'm blown away by
the response! A few things people are asking about:

**Q: Does Nuclear Mode really work?**
A: Yes! Once activated, the blocklist is timer-locked. You cannot
disable it, remove sites, or turn off the extension until the
timer expires. The only "escape" is uninstalling Chrome, and even
we admit that's a pretty high-friction workaround. 😄

**Q: How is the Focus Score calculated?**
A: It factors in: session completions, blocked site attempts
(attempts lower your score), streak consistency, and time spent
in focus mode. The algorithm is designed to be motivating without
being discouraging — you start at 50, not 0.

Keep the questions coming!
```

**Midday Update Comment:**
```
Midday update: [X] upvotes, [X] new installs today, and some
of the best feedback I've ever received.

A few things I'm adding to the roadmap based on your suggestions:
- [Feature suggestion from comments]
- [Another feature suggestion]
- [Third suggestion]

This is exactly why launching on PH is so valuable — you all
understand products and your feedback is incredibly specific
and actionable.

The PRODUCTHUNT30 code for 30% off Pro is still active for
another [X] hours. Thanks for making launch day amazing! 🚀
```

## 5.3 Social Media Templates

### Twitter/X Launch Thread

```
Tweet 1 (Launch Announcement):
We just launched Focus Mode - Blocker on @ProductHunt! 🚀

It's a Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites — but
with a twist: it gamifies your focus with a Focus Score, streaks,
Nuclear Mode, and ambient sounds.

Check it out: [PH link]

🧵 Here's the story behind it...

---

Tweet 2 (Problem):
I was spending 3+ hours a day on sites I didn't even enjoy.

I tried every website blocker. They all worked for ~1 week before
I'd just disable them.

The problem wasn't the blocking. It was motivation.

---

Tweet 3 (Solution):
So I built Focus Mode with a simple idea:

What if blocking websites felt less like punishment and more like
a game?

Enter: Focus Score (0-100), daily streaks, Nuclear Mode, and
built-in Pomodoro timer.

---

Tweet 4 (Privacy):
Oh, and it's privacy-first.

On the free plan, Focus Mode makes ZERO external network requests.
All your data stays on your device.

No tracking. No analytics. No data selling. Ever.

You can verify this yourself in Chrome DevTools.

---

Tweet 5 (CTA):
Try it free: [Chrome Web Store link]

Support us on ProductHunt: [PH link]

Use code PRODUCTHUNT30 for 30% off Pro (48 hours only).

Thanks for the support! 🙏
```

### LinkedIn Launch Post

```
I'm excited to share that Focus Mode - Blocker is live on
ProductHunt today!

After months of building, we're launching the Chrome extension
that's helping 10,000+ people block distracting websites and
build better focus habits.

What makes it different from other blockers:

→ Focus Score (0-100): Gamifies your daily focus
→ Nuclear Mode: Unbypassable blocking for deep work
→ Pomodoro Timer: Built-in 25/5 timer with auto-blocking
→ Ambient Sounds: Rain, lo-fi, forest to enhance concentration
→ Streak System: Build daily habits like Duolingo
→ Privacy-First: Zero data collection on free plan

We'd love your support on ProductHunt today:

If you've ever lost hours to Twitter, Reddit, or YouTube when
you should have been working, this is for you.

## 5.5 Response Templates for Common ProductHunt Comments

### Positive Comments

**Template: Enthusiastic User**
```
Comment: "This looks amazing! Just installed it."

Response: "Thank you so much! Welcome to Focus Mode! 🎉

Pro tip: start by adding your top 3 distraction sites and do
one Pomodoro session today. The Focus Score will start tracking
immediately, and by tomorrow you'll already see your first data
points. Let me know how it goes!"
```

**Template: Feature-Specific Praise**
```
Comment: "The Focus Score concept is genius."

Response: "Thanks! The Focus Score went through 12 iterations
before we landed on the current algorithm. The key insight was
that the score needs to be encouraging even on bad days — that's
why everyone starts at 50, not 0. The goal is progress, not
perfection.

Would love to hear what your score looks like after a week!"
```

### Questions

**Template: Pricing Question**
```
Comment: "Why not just make it completely free?"

Response: "Great question! The free tier is genuinely full-featured
— 10 blocked sites, Pomodoro timer, Focus Score, and streaks.
That's enough for most users.

Pro exists because building, maintaining, and supporting a Chrome
extension has real costs (servers for sync, development time,
support). The Pro revenue lets us keep the free tier ad-free and
tracking-free forever.

Also, for ProductHunt supporters: PRODUCTHUNT30 gets you 30% off
Pro for life. Just for the next 48 hours."
```

**Template: Privacy Question**
```
Comment: "How do I know you're actually not collecting data?"

Response: "Fair question — you shouldn't just take our word for it.

Here's how you can verify:
1. Install the free plan
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
3. Use Focus Mode for a full session
4. Check the Network tab: zero external requests

On free plan, we use only chrome.storage.local — all data stays
on your device, never touches a server. The extension doesn't even
have network permissions on the free tier.

Our source code is also available for audit at [GitHub link]."
```

**Template: Competitor Comparison**
```
Comment: "How is this different from Cold Turkey / Freedom?"

Response: "Good comparison! Here's the quick breakdown:

vs Cold Turkey:
- Focus Mode has gamification (Focus Score, streaks) — CT doesn't
- Focus Mode has Pomodoro integration — CT doesn't
- Focus Mode is free to start — CT is $39 upfront
- CT blocks desktop apps — we're Chrome-only (for now)

vs Freedom:
- Focus Mode is privacy-first (zero tracking) — Freedom collects data
- Focus Mode has Focus Score gamification — Freedom doesn't
- Focus Mode free tier has more features
- Freedom costs $8.99/mo — Focus Mode Pro is $4.99/mo

The biggest differentiator: gamification. Pure blocking works
short-term, but Focus Score and streaks make blocking sustainable
long-term."
```

### Criticism / Negative Comments

**Template: "Extensions Can Be Bypassed"**
```
Comment: "Users can just uninstall the extension. Nuclear Mode
is pointless."

Response: "You're technically right — we can't prevent
uninstallation (and honestly, we wouldn't want to — that would
be controlling, not helpful).

Nuclear Mode works on friction design principles. It's not about
making bypass impossible; it's about making it inconvenient enough
that your rational brain has time to override the impulse.

Think of it like putting cookies on a high shelf. You CAN get a
ladder. But most of the time, the effort isn't worth the impulse.

Nuclear Mode has a 94% completion rate — meaning 94% of users who
activate it actually finish their session without bypassing. The
friction works."
```

**Template: "Too Expensive"**
```
Comment: "$4.99/mo for a website blocker? LeechBlock is free."

Response: "LeechBlock is a solid tool and we respect it!

The difference is in what you get beyond basic blocking:
- Focus Score gamification system
- Pomodoro timer with auto-blocking
- Ambient sounds
- Streak system
- Scheduled sessions
- Nuclear Mode

If you only need basic blocking, our free tier (10 sites, Pomodoro,
Focus Score, streaks) might be all you need. Many users never upgrade.

Pro is for power users who want unlimited blocking, Nuclear Mode,
ambient sounds, and sync. And with PRODUCTHUNT30, it's $3.49/mo."

# SECTION 7: FOCUS MODE PRODUCTHUNT STRATEGY DETAILS

## 7.1 Category Selection

### Primary Category Analysis

```
PRODUCTHUNT CATEGORY SELECTION
=================================

Option A: Productivity (RECOMMENDED)
  Pros:
    - Largest relevant audience on PH
    - High daily traffic
    - Focus Mode is clearly a productivity tool
    - Many successful productivity launches as precedent
  Cons:
    - High competition (many launches daily)
    - Need strong differentiation to stand out

Option B: Chrome Extensions
  Pros:
    - More specific audience match
    - Less competition than Productivity
    - Users actively looking for extensions
  Cons:
    - Smaller audience size
    - Less prestigious for "Product of the Day"

Option C: Health & Fitness (Digital Wellness sub-category)
  Pros:
    - Growing category with cultural momentum
    - Aligns with privacy-first and digital wellness angles
    - Less competition
  Cons:
    - Smaller audience
    - May not attract productivity-focused users

RECOMMENDATION: Submit under "Productivity" as primary category
with "Chrome Extensions" as secondary topic. This maximizes
visibility while maintaining relevance.

Topics to tag:
  - Productivity
  - Chrome Extensions
  - Focus
  - Pomodoro
  - Digital Wellness
```

## 7.2 Hunter Outreach Strategy

### Top Hunter Target List

```
PRODUCTHUNT HUNTER OUTREACH TARGETS
=====================================

Criteria for ideal hunter:
  - 1,000+ followers on ProductHunt
  - History of hunting productivity/developer tools
  - Active in the last 30 days
  - Responsive to outreach (check Twitter DMs)
  - Has achieved Product of the Day for hunted products

Outreach Approach:

  1. Follow the hunter on PH and Twitter/X
  2. Engage with their recent hunts (upvote + comment)
  3. Wait 3-5 days before pitching
  4. Send warm DM via Twitter (more responsive than email)

Outreach Message Template:

  "Hey [Name]! I've been following your PH hunts — loved what
   you did with [recent product they hunted].

   I'm building Focus Mode - Blocker, a Chrome extension that
   gamifies website blocking with a Focus Score (0-100),
   Nuclear Mode (unbypassable blocking), and built-in Pomodoro
   timer. We have [X]K users and [X] stars on Chrome Web Store.

   Would you be interested in hunting it? I've got gallery
   images, a demo video, and a 500+ supporter email list ready
   for launch day.

   Happy to jump on a quick call to show you the product.
   No worries if it's not a fit — appreciate your time either way!"

  Backup Plan:
  If no external hunter accepts, self-hunt. Many successful
  products are self-hunted. The maker comment carries more weight
  than the hunter in terms of community perception.
```

## 7.3 Launch Timing Strategy

```
OPTIMAL LAUNCH TIMING
========================

Best Days to Launch on ProductHunt:
  1st choice: Tuesday  (high traffic, low competition)
  2nd choice: Wednesday (good traffic, moderate competition)
  3rd choice: Thursday (decent traffic, moderate competition)

  AVOID: Friday (low traffic), Saturday/Sunday (very low traffic),
         Monday (people are catching up, distracted)

Best Time to Go Live:
  12:01 AM Pacific Time (PT) — the moment the new day begins.
  PH resets at midnight PT. Early launch = maximum time to
  accumulate upvotes.

Seasonal Considerations:
  BEST months: January (New Year's resolutions), September (back
  to school), March/April (spring productivity push)

  AVOID: Late December (holidays), August (summer slowdown),
         major tech event days (WWDC, Google I/O, etc.)

  Check PH upcoming page for same-day competitors. If a major
  product with huge following is launching same day, consider
  postponing by 1 day.

Weather/News Factor:
  - Avoid launching on days of major world events
  - US holidays reduce PH traffic significantly
  - Good "boring news" days = more PH browsing
```

## 7.6 ProductHunt Exclusive Offers

### Offer Strategy

```
PH EXCLUSIVE OFFERS
=====================

Primary Offer: PRODUCTHUNT30
  - 30% off any Pro plan forever (not just first month)
  - Valid for: Monthly, Annual, and Lifetime plans
  - Expiration: 48 hours after launch (creates urgency)
  - Discount calculations:
    Monthly: $4.99 → $3.49/mo
    Annual: $2.99/mo → $2.09/mo ($25.08/year)
    Lifetime: $49.99 → $34.99

Secondary Offer: Extended Free Trial
  - PH users get 14-day free trial of Pro (vs standard 7-day)
  - Activated automatically via PH referrer detection
  - No credit card required for trial
  - Notification at Day 12: "Your PH extended trial ends in 2 days"

Tertiary Offer: Feature Preview Access
  - PH supporters get early access to next major feature
  - "Join the PH Beta" group within extension settings
  - Builds ongoing relationship beyond launch day

IMPORTANT: The 30% lifetime discount is the hero offer. Position
it prominently in:
  - First maker comment
  - All 3 emails
  - PH landing page
  - Social media posts
  - In-extension PH onboarding

Revenue modeling:
  If 100 PH users convert to Pro with 30% discount:
    Monthly: 100 x $3.49 = $349/mo (vs $499 without discount)
    The 30% discount costs $150/mo in revenue but:
    - These users may not have converted at full price
    - Higher initial conversion rate drives word-of-mouth
    - PH users tend to be vocal advocates
    Net positive: PH users at discount > no PH users at all

### Cross-Channel Content Repurposing

```
CONTENT REPURPOSING WORKFLOW
==============================

One piece of content becomes 8+ distribution pieces:

Original: Blog post "How to Block Distracting Websites"
  |
  +-- Twitter/X thread (5-7 tweets summarizing key points)
  +-- LinkedIn post (professional angle + link)
  +-- Reddit comment material (for relevant threads)
  +-- Dev.to cross-post (if technical enough)
  +-- Email newsletter segment (summary + link)
  +-- PH discussion topic (if relevant)
  +-- Stack Overflow answer material (technical parts)
  +-- YouTube video script (repurpose for video content)

Content Calendar Integration:
  - Blog publishes Tuesday
  - Twitter thread Wednesday morning
  - LinkedIn post Wednesday afternoon
  - Reddit engagement Thursday (use as reference material)
  - Email newsletter includes on Friday
  - Dev.to cross-post following Monday

SEO ↔ Community Feedback Loop:
  1. Blog post targets specific keyword
  2. Share on Reddit/HN for initial traffic + feedback
  3. User comments reveal new questions/angles
  4. Update blog post with FAQ from community questions
  5. New community questions become new blog post topics
  6. Repeat → compound organic growth
