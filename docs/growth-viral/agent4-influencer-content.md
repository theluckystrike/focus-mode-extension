Subject: I built a Focus Score system -- thought you'd want to try it

Hi [First Name],

I just watched your video "[Specific Video Title]" and loved your point
about [specific insight from the video -- 1 sentence showing you actually
watched it]. That's exactly the problem we set out to solve.

I'm [Your Name], one of the makers behind Focus Mode - Blocker, a Chrome
extension that helps people block distracting websites. But here's what
makes us different from every other blocker out there:

-- FOCUS SCORE (0-100): A gamified metric that tracks how well you resist
   distractions. Think "credit score for your attention span." It goes up
   when you stay on task and drops when you try to bypass blocks.

-- NUCLEAR MODE: An unbypassable blocking mode. No extensions menu trick,
   no incognito workaround, no uninstalling. When it's on, it's ON.
   (Your audience will either love or hate this -- great for engagement.)

-- BUILT-IN POMODORO: 25/5 timer integrated directly with the blocker.
   Sites unlock automatically during breaks.

-- STREAKS + AMBIENT SOUNDS: Daily streaks for consistency, plus lo-fi /
   rain / cafe sounds to stay in flow.

I'd love to offer you:
  * Lifetime Pro access (yours to keep, no strings)
  * An exclusive discount code for your audience (e.g., ALIABDAAL30 for
    30% off the first 3 months)
  * [Optional] Sponsorship budget if you're open to dedicated/integrated
    segments

I put together a 2-minute demo reel showing the Focus Score and Nuclear
Mode in action: [DEMO_LINK]

No pressure at all -- if you just want to try it personally, that's
totally fine too. I genuinely think it could help your workflow.

Would love to hear your thoughts either way.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title], Zovo
[Email] | [Twitter/X handle]

P.S. We're privacy-first -- zero data collection, zero tracking. All
focus data stays on the user's device. I know that matters to your
audience.
```

**Full Email Template A2 (Student/Study Channels):**

```
Subject: The study tool your audience keeps asking for

Hi [First Name],

Your video on [specific study tips video] really resonated -- especially
the part about [specific point]. I've shared it with our team because it
perfectly captures the struggle students face with digital distractions.

We built Focus Mode - Blocker specifically for people like your audience.
It's a free Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites, but with
a twist that students love:

FOCUS SCORE: A 0-100 score that gamifies your study sessions. Every time
you resist the urge to check Instagram or Reddit, your score goes up.
Students have told us it's like having a study accountability partner
built into their browser.

It also includes:
  * Pomodoro timer (25 min study / 5 min break, built in)
  * Streaks (don't break the chain -- visual daily tracker)
  * Nuclear Mode (literally impossible to bypass during exams/deadlines)
  * Ambient sounds (lo-fi beats, rain, library ambiance)

Here's what I'd love to offer:
  * Lifetime Pro for you (unlimited blocked sites, advanced analytics,
    all sounds, extended Nuclear Mode)
  * A unique discount code for your subscribers (e.g., [CHANNEL]25 for
    25% off Pro)
  * 2-minute demo reel: [DEMO_LINK]

The free version is genuinely useful (10 blocked sites, Pomodoro, basic
Focus Score), so even students who can't afford Pro get real value.

Would you be open to trying it out? No obligation to post -- I'd just
love your honest feedback.

Best,
[Your Name]

**Full Email Template A3 (ADHD/Neurodivergent Channels):**

```
Subject: A focus tool built with ADHD brains in mind

Hi [First Name],

I've been following your channel for a while, and your video on
"[specific ADHD/focus video]" really hit home for several of us on the
team. [Personal note about why it resonated -- be genuine, not
performative.]

We built Focus Mode - Blocker as a Chrome extension, and while it's for
everyone, we've heard from a lot of ADHD users that certain features
feel like they were designed specifically for them:

  * NUCLEAR MODE: When you know your future self will try to rationalize
    turning off the blocker, Nuclear Mode makes it literally impossible.
    Set it for 2 hours, and there's no override, no workaround. ADHD
    users tell us this is the #1 feature they can't live without.

  * FOCUS SCORE: External motivation system. A 0-100 score that gives
    you immediate, visual feedback on your focus. For brains that
    struggle with delayed gratification, this instant feedback loop
    has been a game-changer.

  * STREAKS: Visual streak counter. Don't break the chain. Simple,
    but it taps into that ADHD need for visible progress.

  * AMBIENT SOUNDS: Brown noise, rain, lo-fi -- built right in. No
    need to open YouTube (and fall down a rabbit hole) just to get
    background sounds.

I want to be transparent: we're not an ADHD app. We're a website blocker
with features that happen to align well with ADHD coping strategies. I'd
never want to overstate what we do.

I'd love to send you a free Lifetime Pro code and get your honest take.
If you think it's useful for your community, amazing. If not, no hard
feelings -- your feedback alone would be incredibly valuable.

P.S. All data stays on the user's device. No tracking, no data selling.
We know trust is especially important in this community.

Subject: Chrome extension with a gamified focus algorithm -- technical deep dive?

Hi [First Name],

Loved your recent video on [specific tech topic]. Your breakdown of
[specific technical point] was excellent.

I built Focus Mode - Blocker, a Manifest V3 Chrome extension that blocks
distracting websites. From a technical standpoint, there are some
interesting angles your audience might appreciate:

  * Built entirely on MV3's declarativeNetRequest API (no background
    page, service worker architecture)
  * Focus Score algorithm: a 0-100 composite metric factoring in session
    duration, distraction attempts, streak consistency, and time-of-day
    patterns
  * Nuclear Mode: browser-level blocking that survives extension
    disable attempts, incognito, and even Chrome restart
  * Privacy-first architecture: all data in chrome.storage.local, zero
    network requests for user data

If you're interested, I could do a technical walkthrough of the
architecture, or you could cover it as part of a "best Chrome extensions
for developers" roundup.

Happy to provide:
  * Lifetime Pro access
  * Technical documentation / architecture diagrams
  * A dedicated discount code for your audience

### 1.2 YouTube Channel Targeting

#### Tier 1: Primary Productivity Channels (100K+ subscribers)

| Channel | Subscribers | Avg Views | Engagement | Why Target | Content Angle | Budget |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Ali Abdaal | 5.5M+ | 500K-2M | 4-6% | #1 productivity YouTuber, massive reach | "Tools I use for deep work" segment | $3,000-5,000 integrated |
| Thomas Frank | 3M+ | 200K-800K | 5-7% | Study/productivity focus, student overlap | "Best study extensions 2026" | $2,000-4,000 integrated |
| Matt D'Avella | 4M+ | 300K-1M | 3-5% | Minimalism + productivity, premium audience | "30 days without social media" challenge | $3,000-5,000 dedicated |
| Keep Productive | 500K+ | 20K-80K | 6-8% | Pure productivity tools channel | Dedicated review video | $1,000-2,000 dedicated |
| Carl Pullein | 200K+ | 10K-40K | 7-9% | Time management / GTD, high engagement | "Best focus tools for 2026" | $500-1,000 integrated |
| Mike and Matty | 800K+ | 100K-400K | 5-7% | Student audience, study tips | "Chrome extensions every student needs" | $1,500-3,000 integrated |
| Jade Bowler | 500K+ | 50K-200K | 6-8% | Study tips, student productivity | "My study setup 2026" | $1,000-2,000 integrated |

**Approach for Tier 1:** These channels have dedicated sponsorship teams. Contact through official business email. Expect 4-8 week lead time. Budget for $2,000-5,000 per integration. Focus on integrated mentions within existing content themes rather than dedicated reviews (better ROI at this scale).

#### Tier 2: ADHD and Mental Health Channels

| Channel | Subscribers | Avg Views | Engagement | Why Target | Content Angle | Budget |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|--------|
| How to ADHD | 1.3M+ | 100K-500K | 6-8% | #1 ADHD channel, highly trusted | "Tools that actually help ADHD focus" | $2,000-3,000 integrated |
| ADHD Jesse | 100K+ | 10K-50K | 8-10% | ADHD life hacks, engaged community | Dedicated review + Nuclear Mode demo | $500-1,000 dedicated |
| Rick Green | 200K+ | 15K-60K | 5-7% | ADHD advocacy, older demographic | "Digital tools for ADHD management" | $500-1,000 integrated |

**Approach for Tier 2:** Be extremely authentic. Never claim Focus Mode "treats" ADHD. Position as a tool that ADHD users have found helpful. Let the creator frame it in their own words. Provide product but let them set the narrative.

#### Tier 3: Mid-Tier High-ROI Channels (10K-100K subscribers)

| Channel Type | Example Channels | Subscribers | Budget | Expected ROI |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Study With Me | StudyMD, Study Vibes, TheStrive Studies | 15K-80K | $200-500 | 3-5x (highly targeted) |
| Digital Minimalism | Cal Newport fan channels, The Mindful Tech | 10K-50K | $200-400 | 4-6x (perfect audience) |
| Productivity Tools | Productive Fish, Focus Quest, Tool Finder | 10K-60K | $200-500 | 3-5x (direct intent) |
| Remote Work | Remote Work Life, Digital Nomad Tools | 20K-80K | $300-600 | 2-4x (good overlap) |
| Chrome Extensions | Chrome Unboxed (extension reviews), Extension Reviews | 5K-30K | $100-300 | 5-8x (exact audience) |
| ADHD Coaches | ADHD coaching channels, focus strategy creators | 5K-40K | $100-400 | 4-7x (high need) |

**Why Mid-Tier Delivers Higher ROI:**
- Audiences are more engaged (8-12% vs 3-5% for large channels)
- Sponsorship costs are 5-10x lower per thousand views
- Creators are more likely to give genuine, detailed reviews
- Comments sections are active and drive secondary discovery
- Creators often become genuine users and long-term advocates

#### Tier 4: Developer/Tech Channels

| Channel | Subscribers | Avg Views | Why Target | Content Angle | Budget |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Fireship | 3M+ | 500K-2M | Developer audience, extension users | "Build a focus score in 100 seconds" collab | $2,000-4,000 |
| Traversy Media | 2M+ | 100K-400K | Web dev audience, Chrome extension tutorials | "Best Chrome extensions for developers" | $1,500-3,000 |
| Web Dev Simplified | 1.5M+ | 100K-500K | Web dev, younger demographic | "Extensions I can't code without" | $1,500-2,500 |
| The Coding Train | 1.8M+ | 50K-200K | Creative coders, unique audience | Fun/playful Focus Score demo | $1,000-2,000 |

**Approach for Tier 4:** Lead with the technical angle. Manifest V3, declarativeNetRequest, Focus Score algorithm. Developer audiences appreciate technical depth and will install to inspect the code quality themselves.

### 1.3 Ideal Channel Profile Checklist

Use this scorecard when evaluating potential YouTube partners:

| Criterion | Ideal | Acceptable | Red Flag |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| Subscriber count | 10K-500K | 5K-10K or 500K-2M | <1K or >5M (too small / too expensive) |
| Engagement rate | 5%+ | 3-5% | <2% (likely bought subs) |
| Upload frequency | 1-4x/week | 2-4x/month | <1x/month or daily spam |
| Comment replies | Creator replies to 20%+ | Creator replies occasionally | Zero creator replies |
| Sponsored content ratio | <30% of videos | 30-50% | >50% sponsored (audience fatigue) |
| Audience location | US, UK, Canada, Australia, EU | Mixed English-speaking | Non-English majority (unless targeting) |
| Content relevance | Productivity, focus, study, ADHD, tools | General tech, lifestyle | Gaming, beauty, comedy (no overlap) |
| Video quality | Professional audio/video, good editing | Decent quality, authentic | Extremely low effort, clickbait only |
| Audience sentiment | Positive comments about recommendations | Neutral | "Another sponsored video" complaints |
| Sub/view ratio | Views = 10-30% of subs | 5-10% of subs | <2% of subs (dead channel) |

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
1. Sudden subscriber spikes without corresponding view increases (bought subscribers)
2. Comments disabled or mostly bot comments
3. Every single video is a sponsored review (audience has ad blindness)
4. Creator has history of promoting scammy products
5. Channel is in a completely unrelated niche trying to pivot
6. Views-to-likes ratio is abnormally low (<2%)
7. Creator has public controversies that could associate negatively with Focus Mode

---

### 1.4 Sponsorship Budget Framework

#### Budget Tiers by Channel Size

| Channel Size | Budget Range | Content Type | Expected Installs | Target CPI |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| 5K-10K subs | $100-200 | Dedicated review | 50-150 | $0.75-2.00 |
| 10K-25K subs | $200-400 | Dedicated review | 100-400 | $0.50-1.50 |
| 25K-50K subs | $400-800 | Dedicated or integrated | 200-800 | $0.50-1.25 |
| 50K-100K subs | $500-1,500 | Dedicated or integrated | 400-1,500 | $0.50-1.00 |
| 100K-250K subs | $1,000-2,500 | Integrated mention | 500-2,000 | $0.75-1.50 |
| 250K-500K subs | $2,000-4,000 | Integrated mention | 800-3,000 | $1.00-2.00 |
| 500K-1M subs | $3,000-6,000 | Integrated mention | 1,000-5,000 | $1.00-2.50 |
| 1M+ subs | $5,000-15,000 | Integrated mention | 2,000-10,000 | $1.50-3.00 |

#### Negotiation Tactics

1. **Start with product-only:** "We'd love to send you Lifetime Pro, no strings attached." Many mid-tier creators will review for free if the product is genuinely good.
2. **Offer performance bonuses:** Base fee + $0.50 per install above a threshold. Aligns incentives.
3. **Bundle multiple videos:** "3 mentions over 3 months for 2x the single-video rate" (saves 33%).
4. **Negotiate usage rights:** Ask for permission to use clips in your own ads. Worth paying 10-20% more.
5. **Propose long-term ambassadorship:** Lock in rates before the channel grows. "Same rate for 12 months."

#### Monthly Budget Allocation (First 6 Months)

| Month | Total Budget | Allocation |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Month 1 | $500 | 2-3 mid-tier channels ($150-200 each) + product seeding to 10 channels |
| Month 2 | $800 | 3-4 mid-tier channels + 1 newsletter sponsorship |
| Month 3 | $1,200 | 4-5 mid-tier + follow-up with month 1 performers |
| Month 4 | $1,500 | Best-performing channel type + 1 larger channel test |
| Month 5 | $2,000 | Scale winning channels + introduce affiliate program |
| Month 6 | $2,500 | 60% proven channels, 20% new tests, 20% affiliate payouts |

**Total 6-Month Budget: $8,500**
**Target: 3,000-8,000 installs from influencer channel**
**Target CPI: $1.00-2.85**

### 1.5 Content Angle Suggestions for YouTubers

Provide these as optional content direction ideas. Never force a specific script -- creators know their audience best.

#### Challenge/Experiment Videos (Highest Performing)

|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| "I blocked all social media for 30 days using Focus Mode" | Lifestyle, productivity | Challenge format = high clicks, great storytelling |
| "I used Nuclear Mode for a week -- here's what happened" | Tech, productivity | "Nuclear" is a hook word, dramatic tension |
| "Can a Chrome extension fix my attention span? (30-day test)" | ADHD, productivity | Relatable premise, real transformation arc |
| "I tracked my Focus Score for 30 days -- the results shocked me" | Data/quantified self | Numbers-driven, satisfying progress arc |
| "I used the Pomodoro Technique with website blocking for 2 weeks" | Study, productivity | Combines two known concepts with a tool |

#### Listicle/Roundup Videos (Consistent Performers)

| Video Concept | Target Channel Type | Positioning |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| "Best Chrome extensions for students in 2026" | Student channels | Include Focus Mode as #1 or #2 pick |
| "5 tools that actually help me focus (not clickbait)" | Productivity | Authentic recommendation format |
| "My 2026 productivity stack (apps and extensions)" | Tech, productivity | Natural inclusion in toolkit video |
| "Free Chrome extensions that will change your life" | General tech | Highlight the generous free tier |
| "Best website blockers compared: which one actually works?" | Review channels | Direct comparison, Focus Mode wins on features |

#### Educational/How-To Videos

| Video Concept | Target Channel Type | Focus Mode Integration |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| "The science behind why you can't stop scrolling" | Science, psychology | Focus Mode as the practical solution |
| "How to actually use the Pomodoro Technique (complete guide)" | Study, productivity | Built-in Pomodoro as the recommended tool |
| "Digital minimalism: practical steps for 2026" | Minimalism, lifestyle | Focus Mode as step 1: block distractions |
| "How I study for 8 hours a day without burnout" | Student channels | Focus Mode managing study/break cycles |
| "ADHD and the internet: strategies that actually work" | ADHD channels | Nuclear Mode as external accountability |

#### Dedicated Review Videos

**Suggested Review Structure (share with creators who want guidance):**

```
1. HOOK (0:00-0:30)
   "What if I told you there's a website blocker you literally
   cannot turn off? Let me show you Nuclear Mode."

2. PROBLEM (0:30-1:30)
   Creator shares their personal struggle with digital distractions.
   How many hours lost? What sites are the worst offenders?

3. SOLUTION OVERVIEW (1:30-3:00)
   Quick tour of Focus Mode: blocking sites, Pomodoro timer,
   Focus Score. Show the free tier setup.

4. KEY FEATURE DEEP DIVE (3:00-5:00)
   Focus Score: Show the 0-100 score changing in real-time.
   Nuclear Mode: Try to bypass it. Show that it's truly locked.
   Ambient sounds: Play the lo-fi beats.

5. REAL USAGE (5:00-7:00)
   Show their actual blocked sites. Show their real Focus Score
   after using it for a few days. Authentic, not scripted.

6. FREE vs PRO (7:00-8:00)
   Honest breakdown. Free tier is genuinely useful. Pro adds
   unlimited sites, analytics, extended Nuclear Mode, all sounds.

7. VERDICT + CTA (8:00-9:00)
   Honest recommendation. Discount code in description.
   Link to Chrome Web Store.
```

### 2.2 Newsletter Outreach Template

```
Subject: Sponsoring [Newsletter Name] -- website blocker with Focus Score

Hi [Editor/Publisher Name],

I'm [Your Name] from Zovo. We make Focus Mode - Blocker, a Chrome
extension that helps people block distracting websites with a gamified
Focus Score system.

I've been a subscriber to [Newsletter Name] for [timeframe], and I
think our product would genuinely resonate with your audience because
[specific reason tied to their content -- e.g., "your readers are
exactly the kind of productivity-minded professionals who struggle
with digital distractions"].

Quick pitch for why this works as a sponsor:
  * Free product with a generous tier (no "install and hit a paywall"
    frustration for your readers)
  * Unique angle: Focus Score gamification is different from every
    other blocker
  * Strong CTA: "Install in 10 seconds, block your first site in 30"
  * We can offer your readers an exclusive discount (e.g., 30% off
    Pro for 3 months)

I'd love to book a single-issue sponsorship to test. What are your
current rates for:
  * Primary sponsor slot
  * Classified/secondary slot (if available)

Happy to share ad copy drafts or a media kit. We're flexible on format.

Best,

PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------

websites and helps users build better focus habits through gamification.

KEY FEATURES TO MENTION (pick 2-3 that resonate with your audience):

1. FOCUS SCORE (0-100)
   What: A real-time gamified metric that tracks how well you resist
   distractions during focus sessions.
   Why it matters: Turns focus into a game. Gives instant feedback.
   Demo tip: Show the score changing as you work. Start a session,
   show it climbing.

2. NUCLEAR MODE
   What: An unbypassable blocking mode. When activated, there's no way
   to disable the blocker -- no extension menu, no incognito, no
   uninstalling.
   Why it matters: Removes the "just this once" temptation entirely.
   For people who can't trust their future self.
   Demo tip: Activate it, then try (and fail) to bypass it. Show the
   locked state.

3. POMODORO TIMER
   What: Built-in 25-minute work / 5-minute break timer. Blocked sites
   automatically unblock during breaks.
   Why it matters: No need for a separate Pomodoro app. Everything in
   one place.
   Demo tip: Start a Pomodoro, show the timer in the popup.

4. STREAK SYSTEM

   sessions.
   Why it matters: Visual accountability. "Don't break the chain."

5. AMBIENT FOCUS SOUNDS
   What: Built-in sounds including lo-fi beats, rain, cafe noise,
   brown noise.
   Why it matters: No need to open YouTube/Spotify for background
   sounds (and risk getting distracted).
   Demo tip: Toggle between sounds during a focus session.

6. PRIVACY-FIRST
   What: All data stays on the user's device. Zero network tracking.
   No account required.
   Why it matters: In an age of data harvesting, this is refreshing.
   Mention tip: "Your focus data never leaves your browser."

PRICING (mention naturally, don't hard-sell):

- Pro ($4.99/mo or $2.99/mo annual): Unlimited sites, full analytics,
  all sounds, extended Nuclear Mode, custom timer durations

#### Email Swipe Files

**Email Swipe 1: The Productivity Angle**

```
Subject: The Chrome extension that scores your focus (free)

Hi [First Name],

I want to share a tool that's genuinely changed how I work.

It's called Focus Mode - Blocker, and it does something no other
website blocker does: it gives you a FOCUS SCORE.

Think of it like a credit score for your attention span. It goes from
0 to 100, and it tracks how well you resist distractions during work
sessions. I'm embarrassed to admit my first score was a 23. After two
weeks, I hit 81. It's weirdly motivating.

But the feature that sealed the deal for me? Nuclear Mode. When you
turn it on, there is literally no way to bypass the blocker. You
can't disable the extension. You can't use incognito. You can't
uninstall it. When Nuclear Mode is on, the distractions are just
GONE.

Other features I love:
- Built-in Pomodoro timer (25 min work / 5 min break)
- Ambient sounds (lo-fi beats, rain, cafe noise)
- Daily streaks to build consistency
- Privacy-first: all data stays on your device

The free version gives you 10 blocked sites, the Pomodoro timer,
and basic Focus Score. That's genuinely enough for most people.

If you want unlimited sites, full analytics, and all the ambient
sounds, Pro is $4.99/mo -- but use my link below for 30% off your
first 3 months.

[AFFILIATE_LINK]
Use code [AFFILIATE_CODE] for 30% off Pro

Cheers,
[Your Name]

P.S. It installs in literally 10 seconds. No account required.

**Email Swipe 2: The ADHD/Focus Struggle Angle**

```
Subject: For anyone who can't stop "just checking" Twitter

Hi [First Name],

Be honest: how many times have you opened your browser to do
something productive, and 30 minutes later found yourself deep
in a Reddit thread about whether hot dogs are sandwiches?

(No? Just me? I doubt it.)

I found a Chrome extension called Focus Mode that actually solved
this problem for me. Here's what makes it different from every
other website blocker I've tried:

NUCLEAR MODE -- I'll explain why this matters. Every other blocker
I've used, I eventually outsmarted. Disabled the extension. Used
incognito. Found a workaround. Nuclear Mode is different. When
it's on, there IS no workaround. You literally cannot bypass it.
My future self hates me for turning it on. My productivity thanks
me.

FOCUS SCORE -- A 0-100 score that goes up when you stay focused
and drops when you try to visit blocked sites. It's gamified,
and for some reason, seeing that number climb is incredibly
motivating.

The best part? It's free. Genuinely free, not "free for 3 days
then surprise paywall" free. The free tier gives you 10 blocked
sites, a Pomodoro timer, and Focus Score.

If you want the full experience (unlimited sites, all the ambient
focus sounds, extended Nuclear Mode), Pro is less than $5/month.
And you can get 30% off with my code:

[AFFILIATE_LINK]
Code: [AFFILIATE_CODE] (30% off first 3 months)

Trust me, your future self will thank you.

**Email Swipe 3: The Student Angle**

```
Subject: The study hack I wish I had in college

Hi [First Name],

If you're a student (or you know one), this might be the most
useful Chrome extension in existence.

Focus Mode - Blocker blocks distracting websites during study
sessions. But here's why it's better than the other blockers:

1. FOCUS SCORE: It gives you a 0-100 score based on how focused
   you are. It's like having a study accountability partner built
   into your browser. My score went from 34 to 78 in two weeks.

2. POMODORO TIMER: Built-in 25-minute study / 5-minute break
   timer. Blocked sites automatically unblock during breaks.
   No separate app needed.

3. NUCLEAR MODE: During exams, turn this on. You literally
   cannot bypass the blocker. No "just 5 minutes" temptation.

4. STUDY SOUNDS: Lo-fi beats, rain, cafe sounds -- all built
   in. No opening YouTube for "study music" and ending up
   watching cat videos.

5. STREAKS: Visual daily streak. Study every day, don't break
   the chain.

The free version is genuinely great (10 sites, Pomodoro, Focus
Score). Pro unlocks everything for less than the cost of a
coffee per month.

Code: [AFFILIATE_CODE]

P.S. It's privacy-first -- no data tracking. All your focus
data stays on YOUR device. That matters.

#### Social Post Templates

**Twitter/X Templates:**

```
Tweet 1 (Problem/Solution):
I used to lose 2+ hours/day to Reddit and Twitter.

Then I installed Focus Mode - Blocker.

It has a Focus Score (0-100) that gamifies staying on task, and a
Nuclear Mode that literally can't be bypassed.

My Focus Score went from 28 to 84 in 3 weeks.

Free Chrome extension: [LINK]

Tweet 2 (Nuclear Mode Hook):
There's a Chrome extension with a "Nuclear Mode" that makes it
IMPOSSIBLE to visit blocked websites.

Can't disable the extension.
Can't use incognito.
Can't uninstall.

When it's on, distractions don't exist.

It's called Focus Mode, and it's free: [LINK]

---

Tweet 3 (Thread Starter):
I tried every website blocker. Here's why Focus Mode is the only
one I kept:

(thread)

1/ Most blockers are easy to bypass. Just disable the extension,
   use incognito, or find a workaround.

   Focus Mode has "Nuclear Mode" -- literally unbypassable.

2/ But blocking isn't enough. You need feedback.

   Focus Mode gives you a Focus Score (0-100) that tracks how well
   you resist distractions. It's addictive in the best way.

3/ It also has a built-in Pomodoro timer, daily streaks, and
   ambient focus sounds (lo-fi, rain, cafe noise).

   All in one extension. No 5 separate apps.

4/ The free tier is genuinely useful (10 sites, Pomodoro, Focus
   Score). Pro is $4.99/mo for unlimited everything.

   [LINK] -- use code [CODE] for 30% off.

Tweet 4 (Social Proof):
50,000+ people use Focus Mode to block distracting websites.

The Focus Score and Nuclear Mode are unlike anything else.

LinkedIn Post 1 (Professional):
I've been testing productivity tools for years.

Most website blockers have a fatal flaw: you can bypass them.
Disable the extension, use incognito, find a workaround.
Your willpower always finds a loophole.

Focus Mode - Blocker solved this with "Nuclear Mode" -- an
unbypassable blocking mode that removes the option entirely.

But what really sets it apart is the Focus Score: a 0-100
metric that gamifies your ability to resist distractions.
After 3 weeks, my score went from a humbling 31 to 79.

Other features I use daily:
- Built-in Pomodoro timer (25/5)
- Daily streaks for consistency
- Ambient focus sounds (no need to open YouTube)

Free on the Chrome Web Store. No account required.
Privacy-first: all data stays on your device.

LinkedIn Post 2 (Team-Focused):
We implemented Focus Mode - Blocker across our team last month.

Results after 30 days:
- Average Focus Score increased from 42 to 71
- Self-reported deep work time up 35%
- Meeting-free blocks became actual deep work (not browsing)

The key feature for teams: Nuclear Mode during deep work blocks.
No one can "just check Twitter for a second."

It starts at $3.99/user/month, but the free tier is enough
to test with 2-3 team members.

#### Email 2: Quick Tips (Day 3)

```
Subject: 3 tips from our top-performing affiliates

Hi [Name],

You've been in the program for 3 days. Here are the tactics our
best-performing affiliates use:

TIP 1: LEAD WITH YOUR FOCUS SCORE
Our highest-converting affiliates share their actual Focus Score
journey. "My score went from X to Y" is more compelling than any
feature list. Use Focus Mode for a few days and share your real
numbers.

TIP 2: NUCLEAR MODE IS THE HOOK
In A/B tests, content mentioning Nuclear Mode converts 2.3x better
than generic "website blocker" messaging. Lead with the extreme
angle -- people are curious.

TIP 3: EMAIL OUTPERFORMS SOCIAL (FOR CONVERSIONS)
Our data shows:
- Email: 4.2% conversion rate
- Blog: 2.8% conversion rate
- Twitter: 1.4% conversion rate
- Instagram: 0.9% conversion rate

If you have an email list, that's your highest-ROI channel.

BONUS: The best-performing content format is a personal story
("I tried Focus Mode for 30 days") followed by a honest review
with pros and cons.

#### Email 3: Check-In (Day 10)

```
Subject: How's it going? (+ a quick payout reminder)

Hi [Name],

Just checking in. You've been an affiliate for 10 days.

YOUR STATS SO FAR:
- Clicks: [X]
- Installs: [X]
- Conversions: [X]
- Earnings: $[X]

[If conversions > 0:]
Nice work! You've already earned $[X]. Payouts go out on the
15th of each month (minimum $25). Your first payout is
scheduled for [date].

[If conversions = 0:]
No conversions yet -- that's totally normal. Most affiliates
see their first conversion within the first 2-3 weeks. A few
things that might help:

1. Have you tried the product yourself? Personal experience
   is the #1 converter.
2. Try the email swipe files -- email has 3x the conversion
   rate of social posts.
3. Focus on the Nuclear Mode angle -- it's our best hook.

REMINDER: If you hit 10 conversions this month, you'll
automatically upgrade to Premium tier (40% first payment,
25% recurring, 90-day cookies).

Need anything? Just reply.

### 6.2 Focus Mode vs Cold Turkey

**URL:** focusmode.app/blog/focus-mode-vs-cold-turkey
**Target Keyword:** "focus mode vs cold turkey" / "cold turkey alternative"
**Word Count:** 2,000-2,500

#### Quick Verdict

```
QUICK VERDICT:
Choose Focus Mode if you want gamified focus building (Focus Score),
a built-in Pomodoro timer, and a generous free tier.

Choose Cold Turkey if you need desktop app blocking, Windows scheduler
integration, and prefer a one-time payment.
```

#### At-a-Glance Comparison Table

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | Cold Turkey |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Price** | Free / $4.99/mo / $49.99 lifetime | Free (basic) / $39 one-time |
| **Pricing model** | Freemium + subscription | One-time purchase |
| **Platform** | Chrome extension | Desktop app (Win/Mac) + browser |
| **Focus Score** | Yes (0-100 gamified) | No |
| **Nuclear/Frozen Mode** | Yes (Nuclear Mode) | Yes (Frozen Turkey) |
| **Pomodoro timer** | Built-in (25/5) | No |
| **Ambient sounds** | Yes (lo-fi, rain, cafe, etc.) | No |
| **Streaks** | Yes (daily tracking) | No |
| **App blocking** | No (browser only) | Yes (desktop apps) |
| **Scheduling** | Yes (session-based) | Yes (advanced scheduler) |
| **Block lists** | 10 free / unlimited Pro | Unlimited |
| **Privacy** | Excellent (local-only data) | Good (local) |
| **Free tier** | Generous (10 sites, Pomodoro, Focus Score) | Basic (unlimited site blocking only) |
| **Analytics** | Focus Score trends, session history | Basic usage stats |
| **Cross-platform** | Chrome only | Windows + Mac |
| **Mobile** | No | No |
| **CWS Rating** | [Current] | 3.6 |

#### Feature-by-Feature Breakdown

**Where Focus Mode Wins:**

1. **Focus Score Gamification:** Cold Turkey blocks sites. Focus Mode blocks sites AND turns your focus into a measurable, improvable metric. The Focus Score (0-100) creates a feedback loop that makes focus sessions feel like a game. Cold Turkey has nothing comparable.

2. **Built-in Pomodoro Timer:** Focus Mode includes a 25/5 Pomodoro timer that integrates with the blocker. Sites unblock during breaks automatically. With Cold Turkey, you need a separate Pomodoro app.

3. **Ambient Focus Sounds:** Lo-fi beats, rain, brown noise, cafe sounds -- all built into Focus Mode. Cold Turkey offers no audio features.

4. **Free Tier:** Focus Mode's free tier includes 10 blocked sites, Pomodoro timer, basic Focus Score, and streaks. Cold Turkey's free tier blocks sites but includes none of the productivity tools.

5. **Price for Casual Users:** Focus Mode is free for casual use. Cold Turkey costs $39 upfront even for basic scheduling features.

6. **Streaks and Habits:** Focus Mode tracks daily streaks, creating accountability. Cold Turkey is a tool, not a habit system.

**Where Cold Turkey Wins:**

1. **Desktop App Blocking:** Cold Turkey can block desktop applications (not just websites). If you need to block Slack, Discord, or games, Cold Turkey is the clear winner.

2. **Advanced Scheduling:** Cold Turkey's scheduler is more powerful -- recurring schedules, day-of-week targeting, and automatic activation. Focus Mode is session-based.

3. **One-Time Pricing:** $39 once vs $4.99/month ongoing. For long-term users who want to pay once, Cold Turkey is cheaper after 8 months.

4. **System-Level Blocking:** Cold Turkey blocks at the system level (not just browser). Harder to bypass by switching browsers. Focus Mode is Chrome-only.

5. **Established Reputation:** Cold Turkey has been around since 2012. It's battle-tested and well-known in the productivity community.

#### Who Should Choose Focus Mode

- You want more than just blocking -- you want to BUILD focus habits
- You're motivated by gamification and measurable progress
- You use the Pomodoro technique (or want to start)
- You want ambient focus sounds without opening YouTube
- You want a generous free tier to start with
- You primarily work in Chrome
- You value privacy (all data local, no account required)
- You're a student or have ADHD and need external motivation systems

#### Who Should Choose Cold Turkey

- You need to block desktop applications, not just websites
- You need advanced recurring schedules (e.g., "block social media every weekday 9-5")
- You prefer a one-time payment over subscriptions
- You use multiple browsers and need system-level blocking
- You don't care about gamification -- you just want sites blocked

#### Migration Guide: Cold Turkey to Focus Mode

```
SWITCHING FROM COLD TURKEY TO FOCUS MODE

Step 1: Export your Cold Turkey blocklist
  - Open Cold Turkey > Settings > Export (or manually note your blocked sites)

Step 2: Install Focus Mode from Chrome Web Store
  - Search "Focus Mode Blocker" or visit focusmode.app/install
  - Click "Add to Chrome"

Step 3: Import your blocked sites
  - Open the Focus Mode popup
  - Click "Manage Blocklist"
  - Add your sites (10 free, unlimited with Pro)

Step 4: Set up your focus preferences
  - Enable Pomodoro timer (25/5 or custom with Pro)
  - Choose ambient sounds
  - Set Nuclear Mode preferences

Step 5: Start your first session
  - Click "Start Focus" in the popup
  - Watch your Focus Score begin tracking

Note: You can run both Cold Turkey and Focus Mode simultaneously
during a transition period. Cold Turkey handles desktop app blocking,
Focus Mode handles browser blocking with Focus Score.

| **Scheduling** | Session-based | Advanced recurring |
| **Block lists** | 10 free / unlimited Pro | Unlimited (trial only free) |
| **Privacy** | Excellent (local-only) | Good (cloud sync requires account) |

**Where Focus Mode Wins:**

1. **Price:** Focus Mode has a free tier. Freedom requires payment after 7 days. Focus Mode Pro is $4.99/mo vs Freedom's $8.99/mo -- 44% cheaper.
2. **Focus Score:** Gamified metric unique to Focus Mode. Freedom tracks sessions but doesn't score your focus.
3. **Pomodoro Integration:** Built-in timer. Freedom requires a separate app.
4. **Streaks:** Daily streak tracking for habit building. Freedom doesn't offer this.
5. **Privacy:** Focus Mode stores everything locally. Freedom requires an account and cloud sync.
6. **Lifetime Price:** $49.99 vs $99.50 -- Focus Mode is 50% cheaper for lifetime.

**Where Freedom Wins:**

1. **Cross-Platform:** Freedom works on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Chrome. Focus Mode is Chrome-only. If you need phone blocking, Freedom is the clear choice.
2. **App Blocking:** Freedom blocks desktop and mobile apps. Focus Mode is browser-only.
3. **Scheduling:** Freedom has more advanced recurring schedules.
4. **Established Ecosystem:** Freedom has been around since 2011 and has a mature product.
5. **Blocklist Library:** Freedom offers pre-built blocklists curated by category.

**Who Should Choose Focus Mode:**
- You primarily work in Chrome and don't need mobile/desktop app blocking
- You want gamified focus building (Focus Score, streaks)
- You want a free option that's actually useful
- Price matters ($4.99 vs $8.99/mo)
- You value privacy and local-only data
- You use the Pomodoro technique

**Who Should Choose Freedom:**
- You need cross-platform blocking (especially mobile)

| **Category blocking** | Yes (pre-built lists) | Yes (categories) |
| **Custom block pages** | Pro | Pro |

**Where Focus Mode Wins:**

1. **Privacy:** This is the biggest differentiator. BlockSite collects extensive user data and has been criticized for data selling practices. Focus Mode stores all data locally and makes zero network requests for user data.
2. **Price:** Focus Mode Pro is $4.99/mo vs BlockSite's $10.99/mo. Focus Mode is 55% cheaper.
3. **Focus Score:** Unique gamification not available in BlockSite.

5. **Free Tier:** Focus Mode gives 10 free sites vs BlockSite's 3-6. Plus Pomodoro, Focus Score, and streaks for free.
6. **Ambient Sounds:** Built into Focus Mode. Not available in BlockSite.
7. **No Upsell Harassment:** Focus Mode's upgrade prompts are subtle. BlockSite aggressively pushes Pro on every interaction.

**Where BlockSite Wins:**

2. **Mobile App:** BlockSite has Android and iOS apps. Focus Mode is Chrome-only.
3. **Category Blocking:** BlockSite has more pre-built category lists.

- You want gamified focus building, not just blocking
- You want to pay less ($4.99 vs $10.99/mo)
- You want a more generous free tier
- You want ambient sounds and Pomodoro built in

#### At-a-Glance Comparison Table

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | LeechBlock NG |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Price** | Free / $4.99/mo Pro | 100% Free (open source) |
| **UI/UX** | Modern, polished | Functional but dated |
| **Focus Score** | Yes (0-100) | No |

| **Cross-browser** | Chrome | Chrome + Firefox |
| **Privacy** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Setup complexity** | Simple (2-minute setup) | Complex (power user) |

**Where Focus Mode Wins:**

1. **User Experience:** Focus Mode has a modern, intuitive UI. LeechBlock's interface is functional but complex and dated. Non-technical users find Focus Mode significantly easier to set up.
2. **Focus Score:** Gamified metric that turns focus into a measurable, improvable habit. LeechBlock offers no feedback or motivation system.
3. **Pomodoro Timer:** Built directly into Focus Mode. LeechBlock requires a separate tool.
4. **Ambient Sounds:** Lo-fi, rain, cafe, brown noise -- all built in.
5. **Streaks:** Daily accountability tracking. LeechBlock has no habit-building features.
6. **Onboarding:** Focus Mode is usable in 2 minutes. LeechBlock requires understanding block sets, time periods, and regex patterns.
7. **Manifest V3:** Focus Mode is built on MV3 from the ground up. LeechBlock has been migrated.

**Where LeechBlock Wins:**

1. **100% Free:** LeechBlock is completely free and open source. No features behind a paywall. For users who refuse to pay, LeechBlock is unbeatable.
2. **Time Limits:** LeechBlock's time-limit system is more granular. "Allow 10 minutes of Reddit per hour" is easy in LeechBlock, harder in Focus Mode.
3. **30 Block Sets:** LeechBlock supports 30 independent block sets with different rules. Extremely flexible for power users.
4. **Wildcard Patterns:** LeechBlock supports more complex URL matching patterns (regex-like).
5. **Cross-Browser:** LeechBlock works on Firefox too, not just Chrome.
6. **Open Source:** The code is auditable. Privacy-conscious users can verify claims.

**Who Should Choose Focus Mode:**
- You want a modern, easy-to-use interface
- You want gamified focus building (Focus Score, streaks)
- You want Pomodoro and ambient sounds built in
- You're not a power user who needs 30 block sets
- You value a polished experience over maximum configurability

**Who Should Choose LeechBlock:**
- You want 100% free with no limitations
- You need granular time-limit controls
- You're comfortable with complex configuration
- You want open-source software you can audit
- You use Firefox (or both Firefox and Chrome)
- You need 30+ independent blocking rules

### 6.6 Focus Mode vs StayFocusd

**URL:** focusmode.app/blog/focus-mode-vs-stayfocusd
**Target Keyword:** "focus mode vs stayfocusd" / "stayfocusd alternative"
**Word Count:** 1,800-2,000

#### At-a-Glance Comparison Table

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | StayFocusd |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Price** | Free / $4.99/mo Pro | 100% Free |

| **YouTube blocking** | Yes | Yes (granular channel blocking) |
| **Privacy** | Excellent | Good |
| **Max allowed time** | Session-based | Daily time allowance |

**Where Focus Mode Wins:**

1. **Modern Architecture:** Focus Mode is built natively on Manifest V3. StayFocusd runs on legacy MV2, which Google is phasing out. StayFocusd's future is uncertain.
2. **Active Development:** Focus Mode is actively maintained with regular updates. StayFocusd updates are infrequent.
3. **Focus Score:** Gamified focus tracking unique to Focus Mode.
4. **Pomodoro Timer:** Built in. StayFocusd requires a separate tool.
5. **Ambient Sounds:** Built in. StayFocusd has no audio features.
6. **Streaks:** Daily habit tracking. StayFocusd tracks time limits but not streaks.
7. **UI Design:** Focus Mode has a modern, clean interface. StayFocusd looks like it was designed in 2012 (because it was).

**Where StayFocusd Wins:**

1. **100% Free:** All features available at no cost.
2. **Daily Time Allowance:** StayFocusd's core concept -- allow X minutes per day on distracting sites -- is elegant and well-implemented.
3. **YouTube Channel Blocking:** StayFocusd can block specific YouTube channels, not just youtube.com entirely.
4. **Established Track Record:** StayFocusd has been around for over a decade with 600K+ users.
5. **The Nuclear Option:** StayFocusd's Nuclear Option was the original unbypassable blocker. It's proven and trusted.

**Who Should Choose Focus Mode:**
- You want a modern extension built on current Chrome architecture
- Future-proofing matters (MV3 vs legacy MV2)
- You want gamification, Pomodoro, sounds, and streaks
- You value active development and regular updates
- You want a polished, modern UI

**Who Should Choose StayFocusd:**

Hi DEV team,

I published an article on building a privacy-first Chrome extension
with Manifest V3: [LINK]

It covers the declarativeNetRequest API, service worker lifecycle,
and local-only data architecture -- topics I noticed are
under-documented for MV3.

I think it could be useful for the many developers migrating from
MV2. Would it be a good fit for the featured section?

Subject: Article pitch: Complete Guide to declarativeNetRequest (Chrome MV3)

Hi [Editor/Quincy],

I'd like to contribute "The Complete Guide to declarativeNetRequest
in Chrome Extensions" to freeCodeCamp.

The declarativeNetRequest API replaced webRequest in Manifest V3, but
documentation is scattered and incomplete. I've built [Focus Mode], a
Chrome extension using this API extensively, and I'd like to share a
comprehensive tutorial.

The article would cover:
- Static and dynamic rules
- Rule conditions, actions, and priority
- Redirect and session rules
- Testing and debugging strategies
- Migration from webRequest
- Common patterns and gotchas

Estimated length: 4,000-5,000 words with code examples.

I've published previously on [platform] and my writing style focuses
on practical, code-heavy tutorials.

Would this be a good fit for freeCodeCamp?

Subject: Article pitch: Gamifying Productivity -- designing a Focus Score algorithm

Hi [Editor],

I'd like to pitch an article for Hacker Noon: "Gamifying Productivity:
Building a Focus Score Algorithm."

It covers the design process behind Focus Score, a 0-100 metric that
quantifies a user's ability to resist digital distractions. The article
dives into:
- Choosing input signals (session duration, distraction attempts, etc.)
- Weighting and normalization to prevent gaming
- The psychology of scores and motivation
- Iteration based on user behavior data

It sits at the intersection of algorithm design, gamification, and
behavioral psychology -- I think your readers would find it interesting.

Draft available if you'd like to review.

#### Example: Repurposing the Pomodoro Guide

**Original:** "The Complete Guide to the Pomodoro Technique" (3,000 words)

**Twitter Thread:**
```
1/ I've been studying the Pomodoro Technique for years.

Here's everything you need to know in 10 tweets (no fluff):

2/ The basics: Work for 25 minutes. Break for 5. After 4 cycles,
take a 15-30 minute break.

But WHY does this work? (It's not just about timers.)

3/ Your brain operates in two modes: focused and diffuse.

The Pomodoro forces you to alternate. 25 minutes of focused
attention, then 5 minutes for your brain to consolidate.

[Continue for 8-12 tweets, ending with:]

10/ If you want to combine the Pomodoro Technique with website
blocking, I built Focus Mode specifically for this.

Built-in 25/5 timer + website blocker + Focus Score.

Free: focusmode.app

Full guide: [BLOG_LINK]
```

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
I used to think the Pomodoro Technique was too simple to be effective.

25 minutes work, 5 minutes break. How could that change anything?

After 6 months of consistent use, here's what I've learned:

1. It's not about the timer. It's about the commitment to SINGLE-TASKING
   for 25 minutes.

2. The breaks aren't optional. Your brain needs diffuse mode to
   consolidate what you've been working on.

3. The biggest benefit isn't productivity -- it's AWARENESS. You start
   noticing exactly when and why you get distracted.

4. Pairing Pomodoro with website blocking is the unlock. During 25
   minutes, distracting sites are blocked. During breaks, they're not.
   Zero willpower required.

I wrote a comprehensive guide on the technique and the science behind
it: [link in first comment]

What's your experience with Pomodoro? Worked for you or not?
