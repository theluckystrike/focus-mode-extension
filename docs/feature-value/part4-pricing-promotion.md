# PART 4: BUNDLE / PRICING STRATEGY

Since Focus Mode - Blocker is a single extension (not a portfolio of products), the traditional "bundle" concept is adapted to **tier optimization** -- maximizing the value perception, conversion rate, and long-term revenue of each pricing tier.

---

## 4.1 Tier Value Analysis

### Feature Count by Tier

| Category | Free Features | Pro-Only Features | Team-Only Features | Total |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Core Blocking | 4 (manual blocklist 10 sites, 2 pre-built lists, 1 schedule, 1-hour nuclear) | 6 (unlimited sites, all lists, wildcard, whitelist, unlimited schedules, 24hr nuclear) | 0 | 10 |
| Focus Timer | 4 (basic Pomodoro 25/5, Quick Focus, break reminders basic, daily goal) | 4 (custom durations, auto-start, advanced break, daily+weekly+monthly goals) | 0 | 8 |
| Stats & Analytics | 4 (daily focus time, sites blocked, distraction attempts, Focus Score number only) | 6 (Focus Score breakdown, weekly/monthly reports, full session history, exportable analytics, streak history+recovery, hourly heatmaps) | 0 | 10 |
| Smart Features | 0 | 3 (AI recommendations, calendar integration, context-aware profiles) | 0 | 3 |
| Social & Accountability | 3 (1 buddy, 1 challenge, current streak) | 4 (unlimited buddies, unlimited challenges, leaderboard, session notifications) | 0 | 7 |
| Integrations & Power | 3 (blanket notification muting, 3 ambient sounds, 2 keyboard shortcuts) | 5 (selective notification allowlist, 15+ sounds with mixing, custom shortcuts, cross-device sync, custom block page) | 2 (API access, admin dashboard) | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **18 features** | **28 features** | **2 features** | **48 features** |

**Feature ratio:** Free includes 37.5% of total features. Pro unlocks the remaining 58.3%. Team adds 4.2% on top of Pro.

### Estimated Value Delivered per Tier

Value is calculated based on time saved and productivity recovered, using the UC Irvine research benchmark (23 minutes to recover from each distraction, average knowledge worker loses 2.1 hours/day to digital distractions) and the average knowledge worker hourly rate of $54.27/hour.

| Metric | Free Tier | Pro Tier | Team Tier |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Estimated daily time saved** | 30-45 min (basic blocking of top distractions, manual activation) | 60-120 min (comprehensive blocking, automated schedules, nuclear enforcement, calendar integration) | 60-120 min/user + 15-30 min/user admin time saved from centralized management |
| **Monthly time saved** | 10-15 hours | 20-40 hours | 20-40 hours/user + team visibility overhead reduction |
| **Monthly value at $54.27/hr** | $543-$814 | $1,085-$2,171 | $1,085-$2,171/user + operational value |
| **Monthly price** | $0 | $4.99 | $3.99/user |
| **Price-to-value ratio** | N/A (free) | 0.23%-0.46% of value delivered | 0.18%-0.37% of value delivered |
| **ROI multiple** | Infinite (free) | **217x-435x** | **272x-544x** |

The ROI framing is important: even the most conservative estimate shows Pro delivers 217x the subscription cost in recovered productivity. This makes price objections nearly irrelevant for the target persona.

### Competitive Price-to-Value Comparison

| Tool | Monthly Price | Features at That Price | Value Position vs Focus Mode |
|------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Focus Mode Free** | $0 | 18 features: 10-site blocking, 2 pre-built lists, Pomodoro timer, daily stats, Focus Score, streak, 3 sounds, 1 buddy, 1 challenge | **More generous than any competitor's free tier.** BlockSite: 3-6 sites. Freedom: no free tier. RescueTime Lite: no blocking. |
| **Focus Mode Pro** | $4.99 | 46 features: everything in free + 28 Pro features including unlimited blocking, full analytics, AI coaching, calendar integration, nuclear up to 24hr | **Best feature density at price point.** BlockSite at $10.99/mo offers fewer features. Freedom at $6.99/mo lacks timer, gamification, and analytics depth. |
| **BlockSite Pro** | $10.99 | Unlimited sites, scheduling, password protection, analytics, category blocking | 2.2x more expensive than Focus Mode for comparable core blocking. No Pomodoro, no Focus Score, no gamification, no ambient sounds, no buddy system. |
| **Freedom** | $6.99 | Cross-platform blocking, session scheduling, locked mode, blocklists | 1.4x more expensive. Stronger cross-platform but weaker in-browser experience. No timer, no analytics, no gamification. |
| **RescueTime Premium** | $12.00 | Time tracking, blocking, detailed reports, daily highlights, focus sessions | 2.4x more expensive. Stronger time tracking but weaker blocking enforcement. No nuclear option, no gamification, no ambient sounds. |
| **Cold Turkey** | $35 one-time | Desktop blocking, scheduling, strict enforcement, app blocking | One-time cost is lower long-term but no ongoing development, no analytics, no timer, no gamification, no mobile, desktop-only. |
| **Focus Mode Team** | $3.99/user | Everything in Pro + admin dashboard, shared blocklists, team analytics, API access | **33% cheaper than RescueTime Teams** ($6/user/mo). Most Chrome blockers have no team tier at all. |

## 4.2 Annual vs Monthly Optimization

### Current Structure

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (per month) | Annual Total | Discount |
|------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Pro Monthly | $4.99 | -- | $59.88/yr | 0% |
| Pro Annual | -- | $2.99 | $35.88/yr | 40% |

### Industry Benchmark Data

Annual discount rates and their effect on annual plan adoption, drawn from SaaS and consumer subscription research:

| Annual Discount | Typical Annual Plan Adoption Rate | Revenue Impact vs Monthly-Only | Examples |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 15-20% | 25-35% | Slightly positive (higher LTV from annual, but few convert) | Notion, Linear |
| 25-30% | 35-45% | Moderately positive | Spotify, YouTube Premium |
| 33-40% | 45-60% | Optimal zone for consumer SaaS | Grammarly (60% off monthly to annual), BlockSite (~64% off), Focus Mode current (40%) |
| 45-50% | 55-65% | High adoption but risk of devaluing monthly price | Some Chrome extensions, aggressive startups |
| 50%+ | 60-70% | Highest adoption but significant per-user revenue loss | AppSumo deals, promotional periods |

### Analysis of Current 40% Discount

**Current math:**
- Monthly: $4.99/mo = $59.88/yr if retained 12 months
- Annual: $2.99/mo = $35.88/yr
- Discount: 40%
- Breakeven: If a monthly subscriber churns before month 7.2, the annual plan would have generated more revenue

**Monthly subscriber expected revenue (at 7% monthly churn):**

| Month | Survival Rate | Expected Revenue (cumulative) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 100% | $4.99 |
| 3 | 86.4% | $14.39 |
| 6 | 64.7% | $25.63 |
| 9 | 48.5% | $33.88 |
| 12 | 36.3% | $39.58 |

At 7% monthly churn, the expected lifetime revenue from a monthly subscriber over 12 months is **$39.58**. The annual plan charges **$35.88 upfront** -- meaning the annual plan collects 90.6% of what a monthly subscriber would generate, but collects it immediately with zero churn risk for 12 months.

**Verdict: The 40% discount is well-calibrated.** It is:
- High enough to meaningfully incentivize annual commitment (projecting 55-60% annual adoption)
- Not so high that it significantly erodes per-user revenue versus expected monthly LTV
- Competitive with industry benchmarks (Grammarly offers ~60% off, BlockSite offers ~64% off)
- Psychologically effective: $2.99/mo stays below the $3/month threshold and anchors as "less than a coffee"

### Recommendation: Keep 40%, but Test 35%

The current 40% discount is near-optimal. However, a modest A/B test is recommended:

| Test | Discount | Annual Price | Monthly Price | Hypothesis |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Control (A) | 40% | $2.99/mo ($35.88/yr) | $4.99/mo | Current baseline |
| Variant (B) | 35% | $3.24/mo ($38.88/yr) | $4.99/mo | Slightly higher annual revenue per user with minimal adoption loss |

**Expected outcome:** A 35% discount would likely reduce annual adoption by 3-5 percentage points (from ~58% to ~53-55%) but increase per-annual-subscriber revenue by 8.4% ($38.88 vs $35.88). The net revenue impact is likely positive but small. If adoption drops more than 5 points, revert to 40%.

**Do not test below 30%.** Below 30%, annual adoption drops below 40% for consumer products, and the revenue gain per subscriber is more than offset by fewer annual conversions.

### Annual Plan Presentation Optimization

Beyond the discount percentage, how the annual plan is presented matters as much as the price:

| Tactic | Implementation | Expected Impact |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Default selection** | Annual plan pre-selected with "BEST VALUE" badge on the plan selection panel | +15-25% annual adoption (proven across SaaS) |
| **Savings callout** | "Save $24/year" or "Save 40%" prominently displayed | +5-10% annual conversion |
| **Daily price frame** | "Just $0.10/day" shown below the annual price | Reduces perceived cost for price-sensitive users |
| **Monthly price anchor** | Show $4.99/mo prominently, then reveal $2.99/mo annual as the better deal | Anchoring effect drives annual selection |
| **Avoid showing annual total upfront** | Lead with "$2.99/mo" not "$35.88/yr" -- the monthly equivalent feels smaller | Reduces sticker shock from seeing a larger number |

---

## 4.3 Lifetime Deal Analysis

### Current Lifetime Pricing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Lifetime price** | $49.99 |
| **Monthly equivalent** | 10 months of monthly ($4.99/mo) |
| **Annual equivalent** | 1.39 years of annual ($35.88/yr) |
| **Competitor lifetime prices** | Freedom: $99.50-$199. Cold Turkey: $35. Intentional: $29.99. Forest: $3.99 (mobile). Opal: $399. |

### Expected LTV: Monthly vs Annual vs Lifetime

| Plan Type | Expected Retention | Expected LTV | Time to LTV |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Monthly (at 7% churn) | Median lifetime: 9.5 months | $47.41 | 9.5 months |
| Annual (at 30% annual churn) | Median lifetime: 2 years | $71.76 | 24 months |
| Lifetime | Permanent | $49.99 | Immediate |

**Key insight:** The $49.99 lifetime deal generates more revenue than the median monthly subscriber ($47.41) and generates it **immediately**. However, it generates 30% less than the median annual subscriber ($71.76).

### Churn Rate Breakeven Analysis

At what monthly churn rate does the lifetime deal generate more total revenue than the subscription alternative?

| Monthly Churn Rate | Expected Monthly LTV | Expected Annual LTV | Lifetime Revenue | Lifetime Wins vs Monthly? | Lifetime Wins vs Annual? |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 5% | $99.80 | $89.70 | $49.99 | No | No |
| 7% | $71.29 | $71.76 | $49.99 | No | No |
| 10% | $49.90 | $57.41 | $49.99 | Roughly equal | No |
| 12% | $41.58 | $50.16 | $49.99 | Yes | Roughly equal |
| 15% | $33.27 | $41.58 | $49.99 | Yes | Yes |

**Breakeven point:** The lifetime deal outperforms monthly subscriptions when churn exceeds ~10%, and outperforms annual subscriptions when churn exceeds ~12%.

Since projected churn is 5-8% monthly, the lifetime deal is revenue-negative in most scenarios compared to subscriptions. However, lifetime deals serve strategic purposes beyond per-user LTV.

### Strategic Value of Lifetime Deals

| Factor | Impact | Quantification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Immediate cash injection** | Funds early development before subscription revenue ramps | 500 lifetime sales at launch = $25,000 immediate cash |
| **Reviews and advocacy** | Lifetime buyers have the strongest "I'm invested" psychology and leave more reviews | Lifetime buyers leave reviews at 3-4x the rate of monthly subscribers |
| **Reduced support burden** | No billing questions, no failed payment recovery, no cancellation flows | Estimated 40% fewer support tickets per user |
| **Word-of-mouth engine** | Lifetime buyers feel ownership and evangelize more aggressively | Estimated 2-3x higher referral rate than monthly subscribers |
| **FOMO acquisition** | "Limited lifetime deal" creates urgency and drives fence-sitters to act | Time-limited deals convert 20-30% of users who would otherwise delay |

### LTV Cannibalization Risk

The primary risk: users who would have purchased annual subscriptions ($35.88/yr recurring) instead buy lifetime ($49.99 once). Over 3+ years, this represents significant lost revenue.

**Mitigation strategies:**

| Strategy | How | Expected Effect |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| **Quantity cap** | Limit to first 500-1,000 lifetime purchases, then discontinue | Prevents long-term cannibalization while capturing launch momentum |
| **Time limit** | Available only during launch period (first 60-90 days), then permanently removed | Creates urgency; late adopters pay subscription rates |
| **Price increase** | If offered post-launch (Black Friday, etc.), price at $69.99-$79.99 (not $49.99) | Higher price reduces cannibalization; still cheaper than Freedom lifetime |
| **Hide from default view** | Show only Monthly and Annual in the default plan picker. Lifetime available via "See all plans" link | Reduces casual cannibalization; only motivated seekers find it |

### Recommendation

**Launch with lifetime deal at $49.99, capped at 500 purchases, available for the first 60 days only.**

After launch, remove the lifetime option from the default plan picker. Reintroduce occasionally at $69.99-$79.99 during:
- Black Friday / Cyber Monday (1 week)
- Anniversary sales (1 week)
- AppSumo campaigns (if pursued, at $49.99 but AppSumo takes 60-70%)

Post-launch, the lifetime deal should never be cheaper than $69.99 to protect annual plan LTV.

**Competitor positioning at $49.99:**
- Cheaper than Freedom lifetime ($99.50-$199) -- strong value argument
- More expensive than Cold Turkey ($35) and Intentional ($29.99) -- justified by broader feature set (timer, analytics, AI, gamification, sounds)
- Comparable to Forest ($3.99) only in the "one-time payment" psychology, not in value

## 4.4 Team Tier Analysis

### Current Team Pricing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Price** | $3.99/user/month |
| **Minimum** | 5 users |
| **Billing** | Annual only |
| **Minimum annual commitment** | $239.40/yr (5 users x $3.99 x 12) |
| **Per-user annual cost** | $47.88/yr |

### Competitive Team Pricing

| Tool | Team Price | Minimum | What's Included | Focus Mode Advantage |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **RescueTime for Teams** | $6.00/user/mo (annual) | 5 users | Team dashboard, manager reports, distraction alerts, goal setting | 33% cheaper. Adds blocking enforcement (nuclear), gamification, leaderboards. |
| **Freedom for Teams** | $6.99/user/mo (estimated, varies) | Custom | Cross-platform blocking, shared sessions, admin controls | 43% cheaper. Adds timer, analytics, gamification. |
| **Centered** | No team pricing | N/A | N/A | Focus Mode fills an unoccupied niche. |
| **Clockify + blocker** | $3.99-$11.99/user/mo | 1 user | Time tracking, no blocking | Comparable price but Focus Mode offers blocking + timer in one tool. |
| **DeskTime** | $7-$20/user/mo | 1 user | Employee monitoring, time tracking | Focus Mode is non-surveillance: focuses on support, not monitoring. |

**Verdict:** $3.99/user/mo is competitively strong. It undercuts the primary competitor (RescueTime Teams) by 33% while offering more features. The team tier should be positioned as a productivity tool, not an employee monitoring tool -- this is a critical distinction for buyer psychology.

### Expected Team Size Distribution

Based on SaaS team plan adoption data for productivity tools:

| Team Size | % of Team Accounts | Avg Revenue/Account/Month | Revenue Contribution |
|:---------:|:------------------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 5-10 users | 55% | $27.93 (avg 7 users) | Moderate |
| 11-25 users | 25% | $71.82 (avg 18 users) | High |
| 26-50 users | 12% | $151.62 (avg 38 users) | High |
| 51-100 users | 5% | $299.25 (avg 75 users) | Very High |
| 100+ users | 3% | $598.50+ (avg 150+ users) | Enterprise territory |

The weighted average team account generates approximately **$71/month** in revenue, compared to a single Pro user at $2.99-$4.99/month. Even a small number of team accounts significantly impacts MRR.

### Team-Specific Features That Justify the Price

The team tier must deliver value beyond "Pro for multiple people." Features that justify the per-user team pricing:

| Team Feature | Value Proposition | Implementation Priority |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Admin dashboard** | Manager sees team focus metrics without accessing individual browsing data. "Your team focused for 142 hours this week." | P0 for team launch |
| **Shared blocklists** | Admin configures a company-wide blocklist pushed to all team members. No individual setup required. | P0 for team launch |
| **Team leaderboards** | Named (not anonymous) weekly focus rankings within the team. Drives friendly competition. | P1 |
| **Team challenges** | Manager creates team-wide focus challenges ("Team focus 500 hours this month"). | P1 |
| **Usage analytics per member** | Admin sees per-user focus time, streak, and engagement without seeing which specific sites were blocked. Privacy-respecting team analytics. | P1 |
| **SSO integration** | Google Workspace or Okta SSO for easy provisioning. | P2 (enterprise requirement) |
| **Priority support** | Dedicated support channel for team admin. | P0 for team launch |
| **API access** | REST API for integrating focus data into existing dashboards (Notion, Slack bots, custom reporting). | P2 |
| **Centralized billing** | Single invoice for the team. Admin manages seats. | P0 for team launch |
| **Onboarding/offboarding** | Admin adds/removes team members. Settings auto-deploy to new members. | P0 for team launch |

### B2B vs B2C Positioning

| Factor | B2C (Individual Pro) | B2B (Team) |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Buyer** | The individual user | Team lead, manager, IT admin, HR/wellness |
| **Decision process** | Impulse or quick evaluation | Budget approval, often 1-4 week cycle |
| **Pain point** | Personal distraction | Team productivity metrics, remote work accountability |
| **Price sensitivity** | High -- it's their own money | Lower -- it's the company's money |
| **Feature emphasis** | Analytics, gamification, nuclear mode | Admin dashboard, shared policies, SSO, reporting |
| **Sales channel** | Self-serve (Chrome Web Store + website) | Self-serve + outbound (LinkedIn, email to team leads) |
| **Churn driver** | Doesn't use it enough | Budget cuts, tool consolidation |
| **LTV** | $47-$72 (individual) | $855+ (5-user team, annual) |

### Should There Be an Enterprise Tier?

**Not at launch.** But plan for it at Month 8-12.

| Tier | Team (Current) | Enterprise (Future) |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Price** | $3.99/user/mo (annual) | Custom pricing ($6-10/user/mo) |
| **Minimum** | 5 users | 50 users |
| **Billing** | Annual, self-serve | Annual, invoice |
| **SSO** | No | Yes (Google Workspace, Okta, Azure AD) |
| **SLA** | Best-effort support | 99.9% uptime SLA, dedicated account manager |
| **Data** | Local per device | Optional centralized data warehouse (enterprise compliance) |
| **Custom integrations** | API access | Custom API integrations, webhook support |
| **Admin controls** | Basic dashboard | Department-level policies, role-based access, audit logs |
| **Onboarding** | Self-serve | Guided onboarding session, training materials |

**Trigger to build enterprise tier:** When 5+ team accounts with 20+ users are active, or when inbound enterprise inquiries exceed 3 per month.

## 4.5 Student / Education Pricing

### Recommended Student Pricing

| Offer | Price | Discount vs Pro | Verification | Target |
|-------|-------|:---:|--------------|--------|
| **Student Pro Monthly** | $2.49/mo | 50% off | .edu email address | Individual students |
| **Student Pro Annual** | $14.99/yr ($1.25/mo) | 58% off annual ($35.88 -> $14.99) | .edu email address | Committed students |
| **Classroom License** | Free (up to 30 students) | 100% off | Teacher verification via school email | High school and university classrooms |
| **University Site License** | $1.50/student/yr (min 100 students) | Custom | IT department purchase order | Campus-wide deployment |

### Verification Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons | Cost | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|------|---------------|
| **.edu email** | Free to implement, instant verification, covers most US universities | Does not cover international students, alumni retain .edu addresses, some schools do not use .edu | $0 | **Phase 1** -- launch with this |
| **SheerID** | Covers international students, verified against enrollment databases, handles edge cases | $1-3 per verification, adds a third-party dependency | $1-3/verification | **Phase 2** -- add when international student demand justifies the cost |
| **UNiDAYS** | Large student user base, trusted brand, cross-promotional opportunities | Revenue share or per-verification fee, less control over the flow | Varies | **Phase 3** -- evaluate after student segment is established |
| **Manual verification** | Covers all cases | Does not scale, high support burden | Staff time | Not recommended except as fallback for edge cases |

### Revenue Impact Analysis

| Scenario | Without Student Pricing | With Student Pricing |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Student installs (Year 1) | 3,000-15,000 (20% of total) | 5,000-25,000 (30-35% of total due to word-of-mouth) |
| Student conversion rate | 0.5-1% (students rarely pay full price) | 3-5% (50% discount removes the primary objection) |
| Student paying users | 15-150 | 150-1,250 |
| Student revenue (Year 1) | $540-$5,400 | $2,250-$18,750 |
| Post-graduation conversion | N/A | 10-15% of student users upgrade to full-price Pro within 1 year of graduation |

**The long-term math:** A student who uses Focus Mode for 4 years of university at $14.99/yr ($59.96 total) and then converts to full-price annual ($35.88/yr) for 5 years post-graduation generates **$239.36 in lifetime revenue**. This is 3.3x the median LTV of a monthly subscriber acquired directly.

### Competitor Student Pricing

| Competitor | Student Offer | Details |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Freedom | None | No student pricing |
| RescueTime | None | No student pricing |
| BlockSite | None | No student pricing |
| Cold Turkey | None | One-time $35 (already low) |
| Notion | Free Pro for students | 100% free for .edu emails (aggressive growth strategy) |
| Grammarly | Free Premium via university partnerships | Site licenses to universities |
| Spotify | $5.99/mo (50% off) | SheerID verification |
| GitHub | Free Pro for students | Via GitHub Education pack |

**Opportunity:** No direct competitor in the focus/blocking space offers student pricing. Focus Mode would be the first, creating a unique position for student acquisition and campus word-of-mouth.

## 4.6 Promotional Pricing Strategy

### Launch Pricing Ladder (Confirmed)

| Phase | Timing | Price | Rationale | Expected Impact |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Beta** | Weeks 1-4 | Free (all Pro features unlocked) | Build user base, collect feedback, generate initial reviews. Beta users become the most vocal advocates. | 200-1,000 installs. 10-30 reviews. Feature feedback. |
| **Launch** | Week 5 | $2.99/mo "founding member" rate (locked for life) | Reward early adopters. "Founding member" creates exclusive status. Lifetime rate lock prevents churn from price increases. | 20-50% of active beta users convert. Founding members become evangelists. |
| **Ramp** | Months 2-3 | $3.99/mo | Gradual increase signals growing value. Creates urgency for fence-sitters ("Price going up next month"). | New users convert at $3.99. Founding members remain at $2.99. |
| **Steady State** | Month 4+ | $4.99/mo ($2.99/mo annual) | Full pricing. All promotion mechanics active. | Standard conversion funnel. |

### Seasonal Promotion Calendar

| Event | Timing | Offer | Target Persona | Projected Uplift |
|-------|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **New Year "New Focus"** | Jan 1-15 | 50% off first year ($17.94/yr) | Knowledge workers + everyone making resolutions | 3-5x normal weekly signups. Highest-intent period of the year. |
| **Back to School** | Aug 15 - Sep 15 | Student pricing launch + 40% off annual for all | Students returning to campus | 2-3x normal weekly signups from student segment. |
| **Exam Season (Fall)** | Nov 15 - Dec 15 | 30% off annual + "Finals Focus Challenge" (free feature) | Students | 1.5-2x student conversions. Challenge drives engagement. |
| **Exam Season (Spring)** | Apr 1-30 | 30% off annual | Students | 1.5-2x student conversions. |
| **Productivity Month** | March | 20% off annual + free productivity e-book/template bundle | Knowledge workers | 1.3-1.5x normal conversions. Lower discount offset by added value. |
| **Black Friday / Cyber Monday** | Nov 25-Dec 2 (varies) | 60% off annual ($14.35/yr, $1.20/mo) OR lifetime at $34.99 (30% off) | Bargain seekers + fence-sitters | 5-10x normal weekly signups. Highest volume period. |
| **Summer Focus** | Jun 15-30 | 25% off annual + "Summer Sprint" 30-day challenge | Freelancers, remote workers | 1.3x normal conversions. Summer is typically low season; promotion counters this. |
| **Mental Health Awareness Month** | May | Free Pro for 2 weeks for all users + 30% off annual | ADHD/neurodivergent community + general awareness | Goodwill + community building. 1.5-2x conversions from ADHD segment. |

### Referral Program

| Component | Offer | Mechanics |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Referrer reward** | 1 month Pro free per successful referral (max 6 months/year) | Unique referral link generated from extension popup. Credit applied to next billing cycle. Annual subscribers get 1 month added to subscription end date. |
| **Referee reward** | 14-day Pro trial (vs standard first-use experience) + 20% off first payment | Referee clicks referral link, installs extension, automatically receives extended trial. Discount code auto-applied at checkout. |
| **Referral tracking** | Unique link: `focusmodeblocker.com/r/{user_code}` | Link installs extension with referral code stored in `chrome.storage.local`. On referee's first payment, both parties are credited. |
| **Social sharing** | "Share your focus stats" card with referral link embedded | Post-session and milestone screens include "Share" button generating a branded image card with the user's stats + referral link. |
| **Cap** | 6 free months per year per referrer | Prevents gaming while rewarding the most active advocates. A referrer earning 6 months free has driven 6 new paying users -- well worth the cost. |

**Expected referral economics:**
- Cost per referral reward: $2.99-$4.99 (one month of Pro)
- Expected revenue per referred user: $35.88-$47.41 (annual or monthly LTV)
- ROI per referral: **7-16x** the reward cost
- Projected referral rate: 5-10% of Pro users refer at least 1 person in Year 1

### Win-Back Campaigns (Churned Users)

| Timing | Channel | Offer | Expected Win-Back Rate |
|--------|---------|-------|:---:|
| **Day 3 after cancellation** | Email | "We miss you. Your Focus Score was 78 and climbing. Come back and pick up where you left off -- your data is still here." No discount. | 3-5% |
| **Day 14 after cancellation** | Email | "Your 14-day streak ended. But your data is safe. Reactivate Pro and recover your streak with a free grace day." No discount. | 2-4% |
| **Day 30 after cancellation** | Email | "One month without Pro. Here's what you missed: [X hours estimated distraction time based on pre-cancellation patterns]. Come back for 30% off your next 3 months." 30% discount. | 5-8% |
| **Day 90 after cancellation** | Email | "Still fighting distractions? We've added [new features since cancellation]. Try Pro again -- 50% off for 3 months." 50% discount for 3 months. | 3-5% |
| **Annual renewal lapse** | Email (7 days before expiry) | "Your annual Pro plan expires in 7 days. Renew now and keep your [X]-day streak, [Y] hours of focus data, and all your custom settings." No discount (urgency-based). | 65-75% renewal rate |
| **Annual renewal lapse** | Email (3 days after expiry) | "Your Pro plan expired. Your settings are saved for 30 days. Reactivate now -- same price, no interruption." Then at day 14: offer 20% off. | 10-15% recovery rate |

### Black Friday / Cyber Monday Strategy (Detailed)

Black Friday is the single highest-conversion event for consumer SaaS. Approach:

| Element | Specification |
|---------|--------------|
| **Timing** | Start "Early Access" on the Monday before BF (7-day window). Peak promotion BF through Cyber Monday. End Tuesday night. |
| **Primary offer** | 60% off annual plan: $35.88 -> $14.35/yr ($1.20/mo) for first year only. Reverts to standard $35.88/yr on renewal. |
| **Secondary offer** | Lifetime deal at $34.99 (30% off $49.99). Only if lifetime is still available; if discontinued, skip this. |
| **Urgency mechanics** | Countdown timer on checkout page. "X people upgraded in the last hour" social proof (real data, not fabricated). "Offer ends Cyber Monday midnight." |
| **Pre-BF warm-up** | 2 weeks before: email all free users with "Black Friday Preview: Our biggest discount ever is coming. Set a reminder." This primes intent. |
| **Post-BF follow-up** | Day after Cyber Monday: "Missed our sale? We extended 24 hours for you." (Standard practice, captures 10-15% additional conversions.) |
| **Expected impact** | 200-500 annual conversions in 1 week (vs typical 20-50/week). Revenue spike of $2,870-$7,175. These users have 70-75% annual retention due to the low price reducing churn sensitivity. |

## 4.7 Price Sensitivity Analysis

### Model Assumptions

- Base: 10,000 active free users (mid-range between conservative and optimistic)
- Conversion rates modeled from competitive benchmarks and price elasticity research for consumer SaaS
- Annual plan mix: 60% annual, 40% monthly at each price point
- Monthly churn: varies by price point (lower prices = lower churn)

### Price-Conversion-Revenue Model

| Monthly Price | Annual Price (per mo) | Est. Conversion Rate | Paying Users (of 10K) | Monthly Churn | Blended ARPU | Est. MRR | Annual Revenue | Notes |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **$2.99** | $1.79 | 4.5-5.5% | 450-550 | 5% | $2.27 | $1,022-$1,249 | $12,260-$14,984 | Highest conversion but lowest ARPU. Below "impulse threshold." Risk: perceived as too cheap / low quality. |
| **$3.99** | $2.39 | 3.5-4.5% | 350-450 | 6% | $3.03 | $1,061-$1,364 | $12,726-$16,362 | Strong conversion at accessible price. Good balance. This was the Phase 01 initial recommendation. |
| **$4.99** | $2.99 | 2.5-3.5% | 250-350 | 7% | $3.79 | $948-$1,327 | $11,370-$15,918 | **Current price. Optimal revenue zone.** Lower conversion offset by higher per-user revenue. Competitive with market. |
| **$5.99** | $3.59 | 2.0-2.8% | 200-280 | 8% | $4.55 | $910-$1,274 | $10,920-$15,288 | Crossing into "need to think about it" territory for students and budget users. Conversion drops faster than ARPU rises. |
| **$7.99** | $4.79 | 1.2-1.8% | 120-180 | 10% | $6.07 | $728-$1,093 | $8,742-$13,110 | Premium pricing only viable with premium positioning. Loses student and casual segments. Freedom territory ($6.99). |

### Revenue Sensitivity Visualization

```
Annual Revenue by Price Point (at 10,000 active users, midpoint estimates)

$2.99/mo  ████████████████████████████████   $13,622
$3.99/mo  ██████████████████████████████████  $14,544  <- Highest potential
$4.99/mo  █████████████████████████████████   $13,644  <- Current (within 7% of optimal)
$5.99/mo  ██████████████████████████████      $13,104
$7.99/mo  ████████████████████████            $10,926

          $0    $4K   $8K   $12K  $16K
```

### Key Findings

1. **$3.99/mo and $4.99/mo are within 7% of each other in total revenue.** The difference is in the composition: $3.99 generates more customers at lower ARPU; $4.99 generates fewer customers at higher ARPU.

2. **$4.99/mo is the correct choice** despite marginally lower total revenue projections, because:
   - Higher ARPU users have higher engagement and retention (they valued the product enough to pay more)
   - Fewer paying users means lower support costs
   - Leaves room for discounting (40% off to $2.99 annual feels generous; 40% off $3.99 to $2.39 annual feels less significant)
   - Competitive positioning: $4.99 signals quality without crossing into premium territory
   - The launch pricing ladder ($2.99 -> $3.99 -> $4.99) captures the $3.99 segment early through founding member pricing

3. **$2.99/mo is too low for steady state** but perfect for:
   - Annual plan pricing ($2.99/mo = $35.88/yr)
   - Founding member permanent rate
   - Student pricing ($2.49/mo is even lower, appropriate for that segment)

4. **$5.99+ is not recommended** unless the product adds significant premium features (AI coaching v2, cross-platform blocking, mobile companion app). At $5.99+, Focus Mode enters Freedom/RescueTime territory and must compete on feature breadth, not value pricing.

### Revenue Maximization by Segment

Different user segments have different optimal price points. The tier structure should serve all of them:

| Segment | Optimal Price Point | How Focus Mode Serves Them |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Students | $1.25-$2.49/mo | Student pricing at 50% off |
| Budget-conscious / "trying it out" | $2.99/mo | Annual plan pricing |
| Knowledge workers (primary) | $4.99/mo | Standard Pro monthly |
| ADHD / high-need users | $5-8/mo (willing to pay more) | Standard Pro at $4.99 -- captures surplus value as perceived deal |
| Freelancers ($50-150/hr) | $5-10/mo (trivial relative to billing rate) | Standard Pro -- no need for premium tier; $4.99 feels like nothing |
| Teams | $3.99/user/mo | Team tier |
| Enterprise | $6-10/user/mo | Future enterprise tier |

### Price Increase Strategy (Year 2+)

If the product adds significant value (AI coaching v2, cross-platform, mobile), a price increase may be warranted:

| Timing | Action | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Month 12-15 | Evaluate price increase | Only if: (1) 3+ major features added since launch, (2) churn is below 6%, (3) conversion rate is above 3.5% |
| If increasing | Grandfather existing subscribers | All current subscribers keep their rate forever. New subscribers pay the new rate. |
| Target new price | $5.99/mo ($3.99/mo annual) | Only a $1/mo increase. Annual at $3.99/mo = $47.88/yr, still below Freedom and RescueTime. |
| Communication | "We've added X, Y, Z since launch. New pricing reflects our expanded feature set. Existing members: your price never changes." | Frame as added value, not price gouging. Grandfathering eliminates churn risk from existing base. |

## 6.2 Feature Discovery Flow (Post-Upgrade)

After a user upgrades to Pro, the following sequence introduces Pro features over 14 days. The goal is to ensure the user discovers and uses at least 5 Pro features in the first week, creating multi-feature engagement that dramatically reduces churn.

### Day-by-Day Discovery Sequence

| Day | Feature Introduced | Surface | Condition | Copy |
|:---:|-------------------|---------|-----------|------|
| **Day 0** (Upgrade) | Welcome celebration + 3 suggested actions | Full popup takeover | Always fires once | "Welcome to Pro! Try these 3 things: (1) See your full Weekly Report, (2) Start a 50-minute session, (3) Explore your Focus Score breakdown." |
| **Day 1** | Custom timer durations | Small banner below timer in popup | Only if user has not yet used a custom duration | "New: Set any focus duration. Try a 50-minute deep work session." |
| **Day 1** | Unlimited blocklist | Counter removed, "Unlimited sites" shown | Automatic -- no prompt needed | Visual change signals the upgrade immediately. |
| **Day 2** | Focus Score breakdown | Tooltip on Focus Score number | Only if user has not clicked their score since upgrading | "Tap your Focus Score to see the full breakdown -- it's unblurred now." |
| **Day 2** | All pre-built lists unlocked | Settings shows all 6+ lists without locks | Automatic -- locks replaced with checkmarks | Subtle but noticeable change in settings UI. |
| **Day 3** | Custom block page | Banner on block page | Only if user visits a blocked site and has not customized the page | "Make this page yours. Add a custom message or redirect to a productive site." |
| **Day 3** | Extended nuclear option | Settings inline tip | Only if user has previously used nuclear | "Your nuclear option now goes up to 24 hours. Try a 2-hour lockdown." |
| **Day 4** | Ambient sound library + mixing | Sound selector shows all 15+ tracks | Small "NEW" badge on previously locked tracks | "Mix rain + lo-fi for your perfect focus soundtrack." |
| **Day 5** | Cross-device sync | Settings panel inline tip | Only if user has not enabled sync | "Sync your settings everywhere. Block distractions on all your devices." |
| **Day 5** | Unlimited schedules | Settings inline tip | Only if user has an active schedule | "Create a second schedule for evening study or weekend deep work." |
| **Day 7** | First full Pro Weekly Report | Notification badge + banner | Always fires on first weekly cycle after upgrade | "Your first full Pro Weekly Report is ready. No blur this time." |
| **Day 7** | AI Focus Recommendations | "Coach" tab highlight | Only if Coach tab has not been opened | "Your personal focus coach is ready. See what your patterns reveal." |
| **Day 10** | Calendar integration | Settings suggestion | Only if user has Google account linked | "Connect your calendar. Focus Mode auto-activates during 'Deep Work' events." |
| **Day 14** | Context-aware profiles | Settings suggestion | Only if user has 2+ schedules or has used nuclear 3+ times | "Try Focus Profiles: different blocking rules for different work modes." |

### Discovery Rules

1. **Maximum 1 discovery prompt per day.** If multiple conditions are met, only the earliest scheduled prompt for that day fires.
2. **Every prompt shows once and never re-appears.** Dismissal (via [x] button) is permanent.
3. **Prompts never fire during active focus sessions.** They appear only on popup open between sessions.
4. **Prompts are suppressed if the feature has already been used.** The system tracks first-use of each Pro feature and skips prompts for features already discovered organically.
5. **After Day 14, all discovery prompts end.** The extension enters steady-state Pro mode with no further prompts.

### Feature Engagement Targets (First 14 Days)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Pro features used (of 28) | 5+ by Day 7 | Users who engage with 5+ Pro features in the first week have 85%+ retention at 30 days |
| Custom timer session | At least 1 by Day 3 | Custom timer is the "aha" moment for users who found 25/5 too restrictive |
| Weekly Report viewed | Within 24 hours of generation | The report is the #1 reason most users upgraded; seeing it unblurred validates the purchase |
| Focus Score breakdown viewed | By Day 4 | Completes the "curiosity -> answer" loop that drove the upgrade |
| Second Pro feature used | By Day 2 | Multi-feature engagement is the strongest predictor of retention |

---

## 6.3 In-Extension Promotion Placement

Subtle, contextual promotion of Pro features to free users without being aggressive. Every placement follows the principle: **show value in context, never interrupt workflow.**

### Promotion Placement Map

| # | Location | What to Promote | How | Frequency | Suppression Rules |
|---|----------|----------------|-----|-----------|------------------|
| P1 | **Post-session summary screen** | Full weekly report | Blurred preview card showing "PRO INSIGHTS" with visible chart shapes below the free stats | Every session after session 4 | Never during the session itself. Blurred card is static -- no modal, no animation. |
| P2 | **Block page (bottom area)** | Custom block page + redirect | Subtle text link: "Customize this page" or "Redirect to a productive site instead" | After day 14, on every block page view | Text only, no visual emphasis. Disappears if user clicks "Not interested." |
| P3 | **Blocklist settings (counter)** | Unlimited sites | Progress bar color change: green (1-7), amber (8-9), red (10/10). "Upgrade for unlimited" text link at 10/10. | Always visible when at 8+ sites | Counter is informational; upgrade link only appears at 10/10. |
| P4 | **Timer configuration** | Custom durations | Duration values beyond 25 shown but greyed out with tiny "PRO" labels | Always visible in timer settings | No tooltip or popup unless user tries to drag slider past 25 (T10 trigger). |
| P5 | **Sound selector** | Full sound library | Locked sounds listed below free sounds with lock icons and "PRO" text. No playback preview for free users. | Always visible in sound selector | Static display. No prompts. User must click a locked sound to see T5 panel. |
| P6 | **Stats tab header** | Weekly/monthly reports | "7-Day History" dropdown visible. "30-Day" and "All Time" options shown but greyed with "PRO" label. | Always visible when stats tab is open | Dropdown is informational. No modal on clicking greyed options -- just brief tooltip "Upgrade to Pro for full history." |
| P7 | **Focus Score badge** | Score breakdown | Score number is clickable with a subtle underline. No prompt until user clicks. | Score always visible in popup from session 3+ | Clicking fires T4 (blurred breakdown). No unsolicited prompts. |
| P8 | **Settings panel** | All Pro features | PRO badges (small amber text) next to each locked feature name in settings list | Visible from session 3+. Badges are static. | Clicking any locked feature fires T5 (feature detail panel). |
| P9 | **Streak display on block page** | Streak recovery | After a streak reset: "Lost your streak? Pro members get 1 grace day/month." One-line text below the "Day 0" indicator. | Only after a streak reset, for 7 days | Disappears after 7 days or after user clicks "Dismiss." |
| P10 | **Popup footer** | General Pro upgrade | "Go Pro" text link (grey, small font) in popup footer | Appears at day 14+. Permanent. | Never more prominent than current footer text size. Never animated or highlighted. |
| P11 | **Chrome notification (Sunday)** | Weekly distraction report + Pro features | T7 weekly alert with estimated distraction hours + "Pro members get auto-scheduling and smart alerts" | Once per week (Sundays), starting day 7. Monthly after day 30. | Suppressed if T1 or T6 fired in the last 48 hours. |
| P12 | **Post-best-session / milestone** | Pro with time-limited discount | T6 celebratory overlay with 30% off and 24-hour countdown | After personal-best session or streak milestone (7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days) | Max once per 14 days. Only the first qualifying event in any 14-day window. |

### Flywheel Step Details

#### Step 1: First Value Moment (Free)

| Feature | Role in Flywheel | Time to Value |
|---------|-----------------|:---:|
| Quick Focus button | Single-click activation eliminates all friction. User experiences distraction-free focus within 5 seconds of install. | 5 seconds |
| Block page with streak + stats | Every blocked-site visit shows "This is attempt #12 today" -- creates behavioral awareness shock. Motivational quote reframes the moment positively. | First blocked site visit |
| Daily focus time counter | "2h 15m focused today" provides concrete evidence the tool works. This is the metric users cite when recommending the extension. | End of first session |

**Conversion role:** Step 1 does not convert. It builds trust. Zero upgrade messaging. Pure value.

#### Step 2: Habit Formation (Free)

| Feature | Role in Flywheel | Habit Timeline |
|---------|-----------------|:---:|
| Streak counter | "Day 7 Focus Streak" creates loss aversion. Uninstalling = losing the streak. | By day 3-5, streak becomes psychologically meaningful |
| Distraction attempt counter | "You tried to visit Reddit 47 times today" creates self-awareness that drives continued use. Users share this stat on social media, driving organic installs. | Immediate (per session) |
| Ambient sounds (3 free) | Rain/white noise/lo-fi becomes the user's "focus ritual." They open the extension specifically for sounds, increasing daily active usage even outside focus sessions. | By day 5-7, sound preference established |
| Focus Score (0-100) | Gamification creates daily check-in habit. "What's my score today?" drives popup opens. | By day 3 (score appears after session 3) |

**Conversion role:** Step 2 creates the habit that makes limits feel constraining. Without habit formation, users do not care about limits. With it, limits create desire.

#### Step 3: Limit Encounter (Free -> Desire)

| Limit | Persona Most Affected | Emotional Response | Conversion Pathway |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 11th site blocked | Power users, ADHD users who discover new distractions | Frustration + validation ("I need this tool to block more") | U1 -> T2 (25-30% of conversions) |
| Blurred weekly report | Analytics-minded users, quantified-self types | Curiosity + information gap ("my data is RIGHT THERE") | U2 -> T1 (20-25% of conversions) |
| Focus Score breakdown locked | Achievement-oriented users | Challenge + desire to improve ("how do I get to 90?") | U3 -> T4 (8-12% of conversions) |
| Nuclear time limit (1 hour) | ADHD users, deep work practitioners | Momentum + desire for more ("that hour flew by") | U4 -> T3 (8-10% of conversions) |
| Lost streak (no recovery) | Streak-motivated users | Devastation + urgency ("I can prevent this next time") | U5 (5-8% of conversions) |
| Fixed 25-min timer | Deep work practitioners, 50/10 or 90/20 users | Constraint + frustration ("25 min is too short for real work") | U6 -> T10 (5-7% of conversions) |

**Conversion role:** Step 3 is where the free tier's carefully designed limits create natural, non-aggressive upgrade desire. Each limit targets a different persona, ensuring that different users hit different walls at different times (the "compound gate" strategy).

#### Step 4: Upgrade Desire (Psychological Mechanisms)

| Mechanism | Features That Create It | Psychological Principle |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Information gap** | Blurred weekly report, locked Focus Score breakdown, locked AI recommendations | Curiosity / Loewenstein gap theory: "I can see data exists about me but I can't read it" |
| **Capability gap** | 10-site limit, 1-hour nuclear, fixed timer, 1 schedule | Functional need: "I need more than the free tier provides to do my job/studying" |
| **Loss aversion** | Streak reset without recovery, 7-day history pruning | Kahneman & Tversky: losing something you had feels 2x worse than never having it |
| **Social proof** | "Top 15% of users" teaser, buddy system, shareable stats | Cialdini: "Others are getting more from this tool than I am" |
| **Sunk cost** | Accumulated stats, streak, blocklist configuration, sound preferences | "I've invested time building this setup -- upgrading preserves my investment" |
| **Endowed progress** | Focus Score showing 74/100, "your score could be 90+" | "I'm already partway there -- just need Pro to complete the journey" |

#### Step 5: Pro Purchase

| Element | Design Choice | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Plan selection panel | In-popup, not a new tab (until checkout) | Reduces friction. User stays in the context where desire was created. |
| Annual pre-selected | "BEST VALUE" badge, visually larger card | Annual plan has higher LTV and lower churn. Push toward commitment. |
| Lifetime visible | Full-width row below annual and monthly | Captures one-time payment preference without cannibalizing annual (less prominent). |
| Price anchoring | Show $4.99/mo first, then "Save 40%" for $2.99/mo annual | Anchoring makes annual feel like a deal. |
| Trust signals | "7-day money-back guarantee," "Cancel anytime," "Your data stays on your device" | Reduces purchase anxiety. |
| User's own stats on checkout | "Sessions completed: 12, Focus time: 8h 42m, Distractions blocked: 187" | Personalizes the checkout. Reinforces value already delivered. |

#### Step 6: Enhanced Experience (Pro)

The moment of upgrade must feel transformative. Key "aha" moments:

| Feature Unlocked | Immediate Visible Change | Emotional Impact |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Weekly report (unblurred) | Charts, heatmaps, per-site data, percentile ranking all revealed | "This data is incredible -- I can see exactly when I focus best" |
| Focus Score breakdown | 5 contributing factors revealed with specific numbers and improvement tips | "Now I know WHY my score is 74 and HOW to reach 90" |
| Unlimited sites | Counter disappears, "Unlimited" text replaces it | Relief + security: "I can block everything I need" |
| Custom timer | Slider unlocks, presets appear (50/10, 90/20, 52/17) | "Finally -- deep work sessions longer than 25 minutes" |
| 24-hour nuclear | Duration options expand to 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h | Power + control: "I can lock myself in for a full work day" |
| Ambient sound mixing | 15+ tracks available, mixing sliders appear | Delight: "Rain + lo-fi + fireplace is perfect" |
| Streak recovery | "1 grace day/month" indicator appears | Safety: "I'll never lose a 30-day streak to one bad day again" |

#### Step 7: Deeper Engagement (Pro Retention)

Pro features create multi-surface engagement that embeds Focus Mode into daily workflow:

| Feature | Engagement Surface | Workflow Integration |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Calendar integration | Google Calendar | Focus Mode activates automatically during "Deep Work" calendar blocks. Zero daily activation friction. |
| Context-aware profiles | Settings / auto-switch | Different blocking rules for different work modes. Focus Mode adapts to what the user is doing. |
| Auto-start sessions | Browser launch / schedule | Opening Chrome means focusing has already started. The tool becomes invisible infrastructure. |
| Cross-device sync | All devices | Block list, schedules, and profiles follow the user everywhere. No unprotected devices. |
| AI recommendations | Coach tab | Personalized insights ("Your peak focus is Tuesday 9-11am") drive workflow optimization beyond blocking. |
| Weekly reports (email) | Email inbox | Even when users forget to open the extension, the email re-engages them with their own data. |

#### Step 8: High Retention (Pro Anti-Churn)

Each Pro feature reduces churn through a specific mechanism:

| Feature | Anti-Churn Mechanism | Churn Without It | Churn With It |
|---------|---------------------|:---:|:---:|
| Streak recovery | Prevents the "I lost my streak so I'm done" abandonment event | 7-8% monthly | 5-6% monthly |
| Weekly reports | Proves ongoing value every 7 days; re-engagement for lapsed users | 7-8% monthly | 5-6% monthly |
| Calendar integration | Embeds Focus Mode in daily workflow; removing it disrupts routine | 7-8% monthly | 4-5% monthly |
| Cross-device sync | Removing the extension from one device means losing sync everywhere | 7-8% monthly | 5-6% monthly |
| Custom sound mixes | Creates a personalized ritual that feels "mine" -- difficult to replicate elsewhere | 7-8% monthly | 6-7% monthly |
| AI recommendations | Creates perceived personalized value that increases over time as the AI "learns" patterns | 7-8% monthly | 5-6% monthly |

**Compound retention effect:** A Pro user who uses 5+ features has overlapping retention mechanisms. If streak recovery prevents churn for some users, and calendar integration prevents churn for others, and reports prevent churn for still others, the aggregate effect is much stronger than any single feature. Target: Pro churn of **4-5% monthly** for users engaging with 5+ features (vs 7-8% baseline).

#### Step 9: Word of Mouth (Growth Loop)

How Pro users drive new free user acquisition:

| Channel | Mechanism | Feature That Drives It | Expected Installs per Action |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|:---:|
| **Social sharing** | User shares focus stats card on Twitter/LinkedIn with referral link | Post-session "Share" button, milestone celebrations | 0.5-2 installs per share |
| **Buddy invites** | User sends buddy invite to friend/colleague | Focus Buddy feature (free: 1 invite, Pro: unlimited) | 0.7-1.0 installs per invite (near 1:1 since invite requires install) |
| **Referral program** | User shares referral link for mutual benefit (referrer: 1 free month, referee: extended trial + discount) | Referral link in popup settings | 0.3-0.5 installs per share (lower intent than buddy) |
| **Chrome Web Store reviews** | User leaves 5-star review prompted after positive milestone | Review prompt after 50 hours focused, 30-day streak, etc. | 2-5 installs per review (reviews improve ranking and trust) |
| **Organic recommendation** | User mentions Focus Mode in Reddit r/productivity, r/ADHD, Hacker News, or productivity blogs | Genuine satisfaction from Pro experience | 5-50 installs per visible recommendation |
| **Team adoption** | One team member's Pro usage prompts manager to buy Team plan | "Focus Together" notifications visible in team Slack | 5-20 installs per team conversion |

**Viral coefficient target:** 0.15-0.30 (each user generates 0.15-0.30 new installs). This is not "viral" in the exponential sense, but it provides meaningful organic growth that reduces customer acquisition cost over time.
