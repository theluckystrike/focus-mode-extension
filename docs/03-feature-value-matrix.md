## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| **Free features** | 15 (29%) |
| **Limited free features** | 12 (24%) |
| **Pro features** | 17 (33%) |

### Top 5 Revenue-Driving Features (Build First)

| Rank | Feature | Conversion Impact | Why It Matters |
|:----:|---------|:-----------------:|----------------|
| 1 | **Weekly/monthly reports** (blurred) | 8-12% | #1 conversion trigger — Grammarly-proven blur mechanic applied to focus analytics |
| 2 | **Focus Score (0-100)** | 3-5% (breakdown) | Unique differentiator — no competitor has this. Score is free, breakdown is Pro |
| 3 | **Manual blocklist (10 → unlimited)** | 5-8% | 11th site limit is natural upgrade moment after habit forms |
| 4 | **Nuclear option (1hr → 24hr)** | 6-10% | Momentum-based conversion — users hit limit at peak frustration |
| 5 | **Cross-device sync** | 5-8% | Closes #1 bypass complaint ("I just use my phone") |

### Top 5 Adoption-Driving Features (Keep Free Forever)

| Rank | Feature | Score | Why It Must Stay Free |
|:----:|---------|:-----:|----------------------|
| 1 | **Manual blocklist (10 sites)** | 8.55 | The product IS this — removing it kills installs |
| 2 | **Distraction attempts counter** | 7.60 | "You tried to visit Reddit 34 times" — creates emotional urgency for free |
| 3 | **Focus Score (number only)** | 7.85 | Highest-scored feature, 10/10 differentiation — the hook |
| 4 | **Basic Pomodoro (25/5)** | 6.35 | Table stakes for focus tools — removing kills reviews |
| 5 | **Quick Focus one-click** | 7.00 | Lowest-friction entry point — onboarding magic moment |

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Most important pricing decision:** Keep $4.99/mo with 40% annual discount ($2.99/mo). A/B test 35% discount. The annual plan should be pre-selected in the upgrade UI.
2. **Most important feature for revenue:** Blurred weekly reports — build this FIRST among Pro features. It's the primary paywall trigger with 8-12% conversion.
3. **Biggest risk to monitor:** Install growth. Revenue depends on 15,000-75,000 installs. All monetization optimization is meaningless below critical mass.
4. **Key competitive move:** "10 free sites" messaging — 3x more generous than BlockSite. Lead with this in store listing and marketing.

### Revenue Projections

| Scenario | Year 1 Installs | Conversion | Year 1 Revenue | Month 12 MRR |
|----------|:---------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| Conservative | 15,000 | 2-3% | ~$6,700 | $1,023 |
| Base | 40,000 | 3-4% | ~$22,000 | $3,200 |
| Optimistic | 75,000 | 4-5% | ~$52,000 | $8,303 |

## SCORING FRAMEWORK

### 5-Dimension Weighted Formula

**Weighted Score = (Acquisition × 0.25) + (Habit × 0.20) + (Upgrade × 0.25) + (Differentiation × 0.15) + (Cost × 0.15)**

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|:------:|-----------------|
| Acquisition Power | 25% | Does this feature drive installs? |
| Habit Formation | 20% | Does this create regular usage? |
| Upgrade Trigger | 25% | Does hitting limits drive upgrades? |
| Differentiation | 15% | Is this unique vs competitors? |
| Cost to Serve | 15% | Server/API costs (inverted — higher = cheaper) |

### Tier Assignment Thresholds

| Weighted Score | Tier | Meaning |
|:--------------:|:----:|---------|
| 7.5+ | **FREE** | Critical for adoption — keep free forever |
| 5.5-7.4 | **LIMITED FREE** | Generous cap that naturally triggers upgrade |
| 3.5-5.4 | **PRO** | Clear upgrade driver |
| <3.5 | **TEAM / CUT** | Team-only or deprioritize |

## PRICING STRATEGY VALIDATION

### Price Sensitivity Model

| Price Point | Est. Conversion | MRR at 10K Users | Annual Revenue | Verdict |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|---------|
| $2.99/mo | 4.5-6% | $1,345-$1,794 | $16,140-$21,528 | Too cheap — leaves money on table |
| $3.99/mo | 3.5-5% | $1,397-$1,995 | $16,758-$23,940 | Good but low ARPU |
| **$4.99/mo** | **2.5-4%** | **$1,248-$1,996** | **$14,970-$23,952** | **Selected — best ARPU, discount headroom** |
| $5.99/mo | 2-3% | $1,198-$1,797 | $14,376-$21,564 | Starts losing conversions |
| $7.99/mo | 1-2% | $799-$1,598 | $9,588-$19,176 | Too expensive for target audience |

**Decision:** $4.99/mo confirmed. Within 7% of $3.99 revenue but with better ARPU and more room for discounts/promotions.

### Lifetime Deal Strategy

- **Launch:** $49.99 for first 500 purchases (60-day window)
- **After cap:** Remove or reprice to $69.99+
- **Breakeven:** At 5-8% monthly churn, lifetime is slightly revenue-negative per user but strategically valuable for reviews, cash injection, and word-of-mouth

### Student Pricing

- **Price:** $2.49/mo or $14.99/yr (50% off)
- **Verification:** .edu email
- **Rationale:** Students are a primary persona, no competitor offers this, high LTV when they convert post-graduation
