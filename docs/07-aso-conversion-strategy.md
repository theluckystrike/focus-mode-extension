## Key Principles Across All Agents

1. **Privacy-first:** No email collection from free users. No tracking by default. All analytics use anonymous installation IDs. Domain names are hashed before transmission.

2. **No dark patterns:** All urgency is legitimate (founding member pricing, real trial countdowns). No fake scarcity, no guilt-tripping, no hidden fees. Cancellation is always one click.

3. **Value before ask:** Every paywall trigger is preceded by demonstrated value. Users see what they would get, not just what they are missing.

4. **Data-driven iteration:** Every change is measured. A/B tests run sequentially with statistical rigor. Decisions are based on evidence, not intuition.

5. **Respect for the user:** Emails stop after clear disinterest. Review prompts only appear at genuine satisfaction moments. Free tier is genuinely useful, not artificially crippled.
