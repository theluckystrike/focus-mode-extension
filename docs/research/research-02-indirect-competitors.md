# Indirect Competitor Analysis: Focus Mode - Website Blocker

> **Research Date:** February 10, 2026
> **Category:** Focus & Productivity Tools (Cross-Platform Apps, Desktop Apps, Mobile Apps)
> **Scope:** Indirect competitors that overlap with website blocking, focus sessions, or productivity tracking

---

## Executive Summary

The focus/productivity app market is valued at approximately **$12.3 billion in 2025** and is projected to reach **$29.6 billion by 2035** (9.2% CAGR). Indirect competitors to a Chrome-based website blocker span a wide range of approaches: cross-platform blocking suites, gamified timers, focus music, virtual coworking, screen time management, and AI-assisted flow state tools. The market is heavily subscription-oriented, with annual pricing between $40-$100/year being the sweet spot for individual users. One-time purchase models (Cold Turkey at $39, Freedom at $199 lifetime) remain viable but are increasingly rare as companies shift to recurring revenue.

## Competitor Profiles

### 1. Freedom (freedom.to)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Chrome extension |
| **Model** | Freemium + Subscription (+ Lifetime option) |
| **Pricing** | Free trial (7 days); $8.99/mo; $39.99/yr ($3.33/mo); $199 lifetime |
| **Key Differentiator** | True cross-platform sync -- block sites and apps across ALL devices simultaneously. Scheduled sessions and recurring routines. |
| **Weaknesses** | Expensive monthly rate ($8.99); some users report VPN-based blocking can be unreliable; no gamification or social accountability; the Chrome extension alone is less powerful without the desktop app. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | ~$1.2M ARR (2021 data); 3M+ users; ~22K downloads/month |
| **Founded** | 2011 (bootstrapped) |

**Key Takeaway:** Freedom proves there is strong demand for cross-platform blocking at premium prices. Their $39.99/yr price point is a benchmark for the category. The lifetime option at $199 creates urgency and appeals to commitment-minded users.

---

### 2. Cold Turkey (getcoldturkey.com)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Windows, Mac (desktop only) |
| **Model** | Freemium + One-time purchase |
| **Pricing** | Free version (basic features); $39 one-time (Blocker); $9 one-time (Writer); $19 one-time (Micromanager) |
| **Key Differentiator** | "Unbreakable" blocks that cannot be bypassed -- the most hardcore blocking tool available. Frozen Turkey mode locks the entire computer. Includes Pomodoro timer. |
| **Weaknesses** | Desktop-only (no mobile); no browser extension approach; aggressive blocking can frustrate users who need occasional access; no cloud sync; dated UI compared to newer competitors. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | Not publicly disclosed; indie/bootstrapped operation |
| **Founded** | 2012 |

**Key Takeaway:** Cold Turkey owns the "hardcore blocker" niche. Their one-time purchase model at $39 is attractive to users who hate subscriptions. However, their desktop-only limitation leaves the browser extension market wide open. Their free tier serves as an effective funnel.

---

### 3. Forest App (forestapp.cc)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | iOS, Android, Chrome extension, Firefox extension |
| **Model** | Paid app (iOS: $3.99 one-time) + Freemium (Android: free with ads) + Forest Plus subscription |
| **Pricing** | iOS: $3.99 one-time purchase; Android: Free with ads; Forest Plus: subscription tier with premium stats and features; in-app purchases for cosmetics |
| **Key Differentiator** | Gamification -- plant virtual trees that die if you leave the app. Real-tree planting partnership (1.5M+ real trees planted). Social features with friend leaderboards. Emotional hook is extremely sticky. |
| **Weaknesses** | Limited blocking capability (phone-focused, not true website blocker); Chrome extension is basic; recent complaints about aggressive premium subscription ads; gamification appeal is niche (skews younger). |
| **Revenue Estimate** | ~$100K/month (Jan 2026); ~400K downloads/month; 4M+ paying users historically |
| **Founded** | 2014 (Seekrtech, Taiwan) |

**Key Takeaway:** Forest is the gold standard for gamified focus apps. Their success proves that emotional engagement (growing trees, real-world impact) dramatically increases retention. However, their Chrome extension is an afterthought -- a purpose-built browser blocker with gamification elements could capture their desktop users.

---

### 4. Serene (sereneapp.com)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Mac only (Windows "coming soon" for years) |
| **Model** | Subscription |
| **Pricing** | $4/month; 14-day free trial; 600-minute test period |
| **Key Differentiator** | All-in-one focus system: daily goal setting, session planning, website/app blocking, focus music, and phone silencer -- all in one workflow. Designed around the "deep work" methodology. |
| **Weaknesses** | Mac-only severely limits TAM; small team with slow development pace; no mobile companion app; limited community or social features; "coming soon to Windows" has been pending for years. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | Not publicly disclosed; appears to be a small indie operation |
| **Founded** | ~2019 |

**Key Takeaway:** Serene's integrated approach (goal + blocking + music + phone silencer) is compelling but hobbled by Mac-only availability. At $4/month, it is the most affordable subscription in this category. The concept of bundling blocking with goal-setting and ambient sound is worth emulating.

---

### 5. Focus@Will (focusatwill.com)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Web app, iOS, Android |
| **Model** | Subscription (+ Lifetime option) |
| **Pricing** | ~$52-70/year; Lifetime: ~$150 (varies with promotions); 7-day free trial |
| **Key Differentiator** | Science-backed focus music with 50+ channels. Personalization quiz matches users to music based on "brain type." Claims 4x productivity increase backed by neuroscience research. |
| **Weaknesses** | No website blocking at all -- purely a music/audio tool; skepticism about scientific claims; the quiz/brain-type concept feels gimmicky to some users; high price for "just music" when Spotify/YouTube exist. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | ~$5.6M ARR (2025); $3.88M total funding raised |
| **Founded** | 2013 (Los Angeles) |

**Key Takeaway:** Focus@Will proves users will pay $50-70/year for focus-enhancing audio alone. Their $5.6M ARR with a single-feature product validates the willingness to pay in this space. A Chrome extension could integrate ambient focus sounds as a premium feature without building an entire music platform.

---

### 6. RescueTime (rescuetime.com)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, Chrome extension |
| **Model** | Freemium + Subscription |
| **Pricing** | Free (Lite); $6.50/mo (annual) or $12/mo (monthly); Teams: $6/user/mo (annual) |
| **Key Differentiator** | Automatic time tracking with AI-powered focus sessions. Detailed analytics on productive vs. distracted time. Smart alerts when focus drops. Burnout detection. The data layer is unmatched. |
| **Weaknesses** | Passive tracking without strong blocking feels insufficient for users who need hard blocks; complexity can overwhelm casual users; the free tier was recently neutered; privacy concerns about monitoring all activity; no gamification. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | ~$2.6M ARR (2024, up from $1.5M in 2023); 2M+ registered users; 11 employees |
| **Founded** | 2007 (Y Combinator); $2.02M total funding |

**Key Takeaway:** RescueTime demonstrates that productivity analytics alone can build a sustainable business. Their $6.50/month annual price is a reference point. Their weakness (tracking without strong blocking) is exactly where a website blocker extension excels. Combining lightweight stats with blocking is a winning formula.

---

### 7. Focusmate (focusmate.com)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Web app (browser-based) |
| **Model** | Freemium + Subscription |
| **Pricing** | Free (3 sessions/week); Plus: $5/month (unlimited sessions); Business plans available |
| **Key Differentiator** | Virtual body doubling -- get matched with a real person for 50-minute coworking sessions. Social accountability is extremely effective for ADHD and procrastination. Growing community of ~1M sessions scheduled. |
| **Weaknesses** | Requires another person (not on-demand for spontaneous focus needs); no website blocking; session times are fixed; can feel awkward for introverts; limited offline value; camera-required model excludes some users. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | ~$84K ARR (2020); growth trajectory unclear; $921K total funding |
| **Founded** | 2016 (NYC) |

**Key Takeaway:** Focusmate proves social accountability drives focus. At $5/month, it is the most affordable paid tier in the category. Their community-driven model is hard to replicate but the insight -- that accountability matters -- can be incorporated into a blocker via shared focus sessions or team features.

---

### 8. Opal (opal.so)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | iOS, Mac (Apple ecosystem only) |
| **Model** | Freemium + Subscription |
| **Pricing** | Free version available; Premium: ~$14.99/mo or ~$99.99/year |
| **Key Differentiator** | Beautiful, modern UI for screen time management. Deep iOS integration. Focus sessions with app blocking. The #1 screen time app on the App Store. Strong branding and design-forward approach. |
| **Weaknesses** | Apple-only (no Windows, Android, or Chrome extension); expensive ($100/yr is steep); some features overlap with built-in iOS Screen Time; no website-level blocking granularity; aggressive upselling in-app. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | ~$10.3M ARR (2024) with just 11 people at time of reporting (now ~66 employees); $6.91M total funding |
| **Founded** | 2020 |

**Key Takeaway:** Opal is the breakout success story in this space -- hitting $10M ARR in ~2 years with a tiny team. Their premium pricing ($100/yr) works because of exceptional design and strong App Store positioning. They prove the market will pay premium prices for a polished focus tool. Their Apple-only limitation leaves Windows/Chrome users completely unserved.

### 9. ScreenZen (screenzen.co)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | iOS, Android |
| **Model** | Free (donation-supported) + Hardware product |
| **Pricing** | App: completely free (donations accepted); Halo hardware device: $49 (shipping Feb 2026) |
| **Key Differentiator** | Intentional friction model -- adds delays and prompts ("Is this important?") before opening distracting apps rather than hard-blocking them. Configurable per app, per day. Launching a physical device (Halo) for home/office distraction blocking. |
| **Weaknesses** | No revenue model for the app itself (donation-only is unsustainable long-term); mobile-only (no desktop/browser); the "friction" approach may not be strong enough for users who need hard blocks; hardware pivot suggests app monetization struggles. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | Not disclosed; 700K+ downloads; ~1.4K downloads/day |
| **Founded** | ~2020 |

**Key Takeaway:** ScreenZen's "intentional friction" approach (delay before opening, not hard blocking) is a compelling UX innovation worth studying. Their move to hardware (Halo at $49) suggests the free app model is not financially sustainable. The friction-based approach could be a feature within a Chrome extension (e.g., a 10-second delay before loading a blocked site).

---

### 10. Centered / Sukha (centered.app / thesukha.co)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Mac, Windows (desktop app) |
| **Model** | Freemium + Subscription |
| **Pricing** | Free tier available; Premium: $20/month; 3-day free trial |
| **Key Differentiator** | AI-powered "flow coach" that detects when you drift off task and nudges you back. 100+ hours of flow music. Task management integrated with focus sessions. Notification blocking and mono-tasking mode. |
| **Weaknesses** | Expensive at $20/month (highest in category); desktop-only (no browser extension); AI coaching may feel intrusive; rebranding from Centered to Sukha creates confusion; no mobile app. |
| **Revenue Estimate** | Not publicly disclosed; $7.86M total funding raised |
| **Founded** | ~2020 |

**Key Takeaway:** Centered/Sukha occupies the premium end of the market at $20/month. Their AI coaching concept is innovative but the price point limits adoption. The $7.86M in funding suggests investor confidence, but the rebrand hints at product-market fit challenges. Their weakness is accessibility -- a Chrome extension at $3-5/month could deliver 80% of the value.

## Pricing Analysis

### Price Tier Distribution

| Price Tier | Competitors | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| **Free / Donation** | ScreenZen, Forest (Android) | Struggles to monetize; ScreenZen pivoting to hardware |
| **$0-5/month** | Forest ($3.99 one-time), Serene ($4/mo), Focusmate ($5/mo) | Accessible entry point; high conversion from free; good for building large user bases |
| **$5-10/month** | Freedom ($3.33-8.99/mo), RescueTime ($6.50-12/mo) | Sweet spot for productivity tools; users perceive fair value |
| **$10-15/month** | Opal ($14.99/mo) | Premium positioning requires exceptional design/branding |
| **$15-20+/month** | Centered ($20/mo) | Niche/enterprise positioning; limits consumer adoption |
| **One-time purchase** | Cold Turkey ($39), Freedom ($199 lifetime), Forest ($3.99) | Appeals to subscription-fatigued users; harder to sustain development long-term |

### Key Pricing Insights

1. **The $3-7/month sweet spot:** Most successful consumer focus tools price between $3-7/month (billed annually). This maps to $36-84/year, which users perceive as reasonable for a productivity tool.

2. **Annual billing is standard:** Nearly every competitor offers annual billing at a significant discount (typically 40-60% off monthly). This is the dominant monetization approach.

3. **Free tiers are necessary but limited:** Every successful competitor offers some free access (trial or limited free tier). The key is making the free tier useful enough to demonstrate value but limited enough to drive upgrades.

4. **Lifetime deals create urgency but cap revenue:** Freedom ($199) and Focus@Will (~$150) offer lifetime options. These work well for early growth and cash flow but limit long-term revenue per user.

5. **One-time purchases are declining:** Cold Turkey ($39 one-time) is an outlier. The trend across the market is decisively toward subscriptions, as they provide sustainable revenue for ongoing development.

### Monetization Models That Work

| Model | Example | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Freemium + Annual Subscription** | RescueTime, Opal, Freedom | Most proven model in the category. Free tier for acquisition, annual sub for retention. |
| **Low One-Time Purchase + IAP** | Forest | Works for mobile; harder for browser extensions. |
| **One-Time Purchase** | Cold Turkey | Viable for indie developers; limits growth ceiling. |
| **Donation/Free** | ScreenZen | Not financially sustainable as primary model. |
| **Premium Subscription ($15+/mo)** | Centered | Only viable with substantial differentiation (AI, etc.) |

### Revenue Benchmarks

| Revenue Tier | Companies | What It Takes |
|---|---|---|
| **$10M+ ARR** | Opal | Exceptional design, strong App Store presence, premium pricing, VC-backed growth |
| **$2-6M ARR** | RescueTime, Focus@Will | Established brand (7-10+ years), loyal user base, cross-platform presence |
| **$1-2M ARR** | Freedom, Forest | Bootstrapped/efficient operations, niche positioning, moderate pricing |
| **<$1M ARR** | Focusmate, ScreenZen, Serene | Early stage, niche approach, limited platform availability |

## Strategic Implications for Focus Mode Extension

### Gaps in the Market

1. **No dominant Chrome-native solution:** Every major competitor is primarily a desktop app, mobile app, or web platform. None have built a Chrome extension as their primary product with the full feature set (blocking + Pomodoro + stats).

2. **Cross-platform competitors ignore Chrome-only users:** Freedom, Opal, and Centered require installing native apps. Users who just want a lightweight browser solution are underserved.

3. **Gamification + blocking is unexplored in extensions:** Forest has gamification but weak blocking. Cold Turkey has strong blocking but no gamification. No one combines both in a Chrome extension.

4. **The $3-5/month tier is wide open for extensions:** Most Chrome extensions are either free (ad-supported) or premium ($1-3/month). A $3-5/month extension with Pomodoro + blocking + stats would be competitively positioned.

5. **Productivity stats are a retention hook:** RescueTime proves users love data about their habits. Lightweight stats (time saved, sites blocked, focus streaks) could dramatically increase retention without the complexity of full time-tracking.

### Recommended Competitive Positioning

- **Price:** $3.99/month or $29.99/year (below Freedom's $39.99/yr, above free alternatives)
- **Model:** Freemium with a generous free tier (3 focus sessions/day, basic blocking) to drive adoption
- **Differentiation:** The ONLY Chrome extension that combines serious website blocking, Pomodoro timer, productivity stats, and lightweight gamification -- without requiring a native app install
- **Borrow from competitors:**
  - From Forest: Gamification and emotional engagement (streaks, visual progress)
  - From Cold Turkey: Strong, hard-to-bypass blocking that users can trust
  - From RescueTime: Lightweight productivity stats and focus scores
  - From ScreenZen: Intentional friction mode as an alternative to hard blocking
  - From Serene: Integrated daily goal-setting before focus sessions
  - From Focusmate: Social accountability features (shared focus sessions)
