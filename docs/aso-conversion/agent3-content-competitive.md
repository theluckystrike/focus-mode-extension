#### Comparison Content (High Intent)

##### 1. Focus Mode - Blocker vs BlockSite

**Target Keyword:** "blocksite alternative" (also "blocksite free alternative", "blocksite too expensive")

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | BlockSite |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Free Sites Allowed | 10 | 3 |
| Price (Monthly) | $4.99/mo | $10.99/mo |
| Price (Annual) | $2.99/mo ($35.88/yr) | $5.49/mo ($65.88/yr) |
| Lifetime Option | $49.99 | None |
| Focus Score | Yes (0-100 gamified) | No |
| Pomodoro Timer | Built-in (25/5) | No |
| Streak Tracking | Yes | No |
| Nuclear Mode | Yes (unbypassable lock) | Yes (similar) |
| Ambient Sounds | 3 included | No |
| Custom Block Page | Yes (motivational) | Yes (basic redirect) |
| Schedule Blocking | Yes | Yes (Pro only) |
| Privacy | No data collection | Collects browsing data |
| Sync Across Devices | Pro | Pro |

**Honest Pros/Cons:**

*BlockSite Pros:* Larger user base (established trust), mobile app available, team/parental features.
*BlockSite Cons:* Expensive ($10.99/mo is 2x our Pro), aggressive upselling in free tier, privacy concerns (data collection disclosed in policy), only 3 free sites, no productivity features beyond blocking.

*Focus Mode Pros:* 3.3x more free sites (10 vs 3), half the price at Pro, Focus Score gamification is unique, Pomodoro built-in, privacy-first, lifetime purchase option.
*Focus Mode Cons:* Newer (smaller user base), Chrome-only (no mobile app yet), fewer enterprise features.

**Best For:**
- BlockSite: Teams needing admin controls, parents needing content filtering, users wanting mobile + desktop sync
- Focus Mode: Individual users who want blocking + productivity tools, budget-conscious users, privacy-focused users, students

**Verdict/Recommendation:** Focus Mode - Blocker delivers more value at every price point. Unless you specifically need mobile app support or team admin features, Focus Mode is the better choice for individual productivity.

**Word Count:** 2,500 | **CTA:** "Switch from BlockSite" migration guide link + CWS install button

##### 2. Focus Mode - Blocker vs StayFocusd

**Target Keyword:** "stayfocusd alternative" (also "stayfocusd not working", "stayfocusd replacement")

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | StayFocusd |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Price | Free / Pro $4.99 | Completely Free |
| Last Updated | Active development | Infrequent updates |
| Focus Score | Yes | No |
| Pomodoro Timer | Built-in | No |
| Streak Tracking | Yes | No |
| Nuclear Option | Yes | Yes (original inventor) |
| Ambient Sounds | 3 included | No |
| Block Page Design | Modern, motivational | Basic, dated |
| UI/UX | Modern, clean | Functional but dated |
| Schedule Blocking | Yes | Yes |
| Require Challenge to Unblock | Yes | Yes |
| Max Sites (Free) | 10 | Unlimited |

**Honest Pros/Cons:**

*StayFocusd Pros:* Completely free with no limits, long track record, Nuclear Option pioneer, lightweight.
*StayFocusd Cons:* Dated UI (looks circa 2015), no productivity features, rare updates raise Manifest V3 compatibility concerns, no gamification, no ambient sounds, basic block page.

*Focus Mode Pros:* Modern UI/UX, Focus Score gamification, Pomodoro timer, streak tracking, ambient sounds, actively developed, motivational block page.
*Focus Mode Cons:* Free tier limited to 10 sites (StayFocusd has no limit), Pro features cost money.

**Best For:**
- StayFocusd: Users who want unlimited blocking for $0 and do not care about UI or extra features
- Focus Mode: Users who want a modern experience, productivity tools beyond just blocking, gamification to stay motivated

**Verdict/Recommendation:** StayFocusd is a solid free option if all you need is raw blocking power. But Focus Mode - Blocker transforms website blocking into a productivity system with Focus Score, Pomodoro, and streaks. For most users, the 10 free sites are enough, and the motivation tools make Focus Mode the better long-term choice.

**Word Count:** 2,200 | **CTA:** "Upgrade your blocking experience" + CWS install button

##### 3. Focus Mode - Blocker vs LeechBlock NG

**Target Keyword:** "leechblock alternative" (also "leechblock easier alternative", "simple website blocker chrome")

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | LeechBlock NG |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Price | Free / Pro $4.99 | Completely Free |
| Setup Complexity | 2 minutes | 10-15 minutes |
| UI/UX | Simple, visual | Complex, text-heavy |
| Block Sets | Unified list | 30 separate block sets |
| Focus Score | Yes | No |
| Pomodoro Timer | Built-in | No |
| Streak Tracking | Yes | No |
| Regex Blocking | Pro | Yes (native) |
| Time-Based Rules | Schedules | Highly granular time rules |
| Statistics | Focus Score + session data | Basic time tracking |

**Honest Pros/Cons:**

*LeechBlock NG Pros:* Extremely granular control, 30 block sets with individual rules, regex support, completely free, open-source, highly configurable for power users.
*LeechBlock NG Cons:* Intimidating setup for non-technical users, no gamification, no productivity features, UI requires reading documentation, steep learning curve.

*Focus Mode Pros:* Setup in under 2 minutes, beautiful modern UI, Focus Score + streaks + Pomodoro, motivational block page, ambient sounds.
*Focus Mode Cons:* Less granular time rules than LeechBlock, no regex in free tier, fewer block set categories.

**Best For:**
- LeechBlock NG: Developers and power users who want maximum control and do not mind complexity
- Focus Mode: Everyone else -- users who want effective blocking without a learning curve, plus motivation tools

**Verdict/Recommendation:** LeechBlock NG is the Swiss Army knife of website blockers. If you enjoy configuring complex rule sets and want absolute control, it is excellent. For the 90% of users who want something that works in 2 minutes and keeps them motivated, Focus Mode - Blocker is the clear winner.

**Word Count:** 2,000 | **CTA:** "Simple but powerful blocking" + CWS install button

##### 4. Focus Mode - Blocker vs Freedom

**Target Keyword:** "freedom app alternative" (also "freedom app cheaper alternative", "freedom app free alternative")

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | Freedom |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Price (Monthly) | $4.99/mo | $8.99/mo |
| Price (Annual) | $2.99/mo ($35.88/yr) | $3.33/mo ($39.99/yr) |
| Lifetime | $49.99 | $159.99 |
| Free Tier | 10 sites, full features | 7 free sessions total (not sites) |
| Cross-Platform | Chrome (more coming) | Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Chrome |
| Focus Score | Yes | No |
| Pomodoro Timer | Built-in | No |
| Streak Tracking | Yes | No |
| Ambient Sounds | 3 included | Yes (separate Ambient Sounds feature) |
| Session Scheduling | Yes | Yes (advanced) |
| Locked Mode | Nuclear Mode | Locked Mode |

**Honest Pros/Cons:**

*Freedom Pros:* True cross-platform (blocks across all devices simultaneously), advanced scheduling, established brand, desktop app blocks non-browser distractions.
*Freedom Cons:* Expensive ($8.99/mo or $159.99 lifetime), "free trial" is only 7 sessions total then hard paywall, no gamification, no Focus Score, no Pomodoro.

*Focus Mode Pros:* 67% cheaper lifetime ($49.99 vs $159.99), generous free tier (10 sites forever vs 7 sessions total), Focus Score + streaks + Pomodoro, privacy-first.
*Focus Mode Cons:* Chrome-only (no system-level blocking), cannot block desktop apps, no mobile app yet.

**Best For:**
- Freedom: Users who need system-level blocking across all devices and apps, not just browsers
- Focus Mode: Users who primarily get distracted by websites, want gamification and productivity tools, and prefer honest pricing

**Verdict/Recommendation:** Freedom is the premium choice for cross-platform, system-level blocking. But if your distractions are primarily web-based (and for most people, they are), Focus Mode - Blocker gives you more productivity features at a fraction of the cost, with a free tier that actually lets you use the product.

**Word Count:** 2,400 | **CTA:** "All the focus, fraction of the price" + CWS install button

##### 5. Focus Mode - Blocker vs Forest

**Target Keyword:** "forest app alternative" (also "forest chrome extension alternative", "forest app for chrome")

| Feature | Focus Mode - Blocker | Forest |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Price | Free / Pro $4.99/mo | $3.99 one-time (mobile), Free Chrome |
| Gamification | Focus Score (0-100), Streaks | Virtual tree growing |
| Blocking Power | Full URL/domain blocking, Nuclear Mode | Very light blocking (can easily bypass) |
| Pomodoro Timer | Built-in (25/5 configurable) | Timer-based (similar concept) |
| Block Page | Custom motivational page | Growing tree animation |
| Ambient Sounds | 3 sounds | Forest sounds |
| Scheduling | Yes | No |
| Stats/Analytics | Focus Score history, session data | Tree/forest visualization |

**Honest Pros/Cons:**

*Forest Pros:* Charming visual metaphor (growing trees), mobile-first experience, one-time payment, social planting feature, real tree planting charity tie-in.
*Forest Cons:* Blocking is trivially easy to bypass (just close the tab), Chrome extension is very limited compared to mobile, no Nuclear Mode, no schedule blocking, gamification is cute but not data-driven.

*Focus Mode Pros:* Serious blocking power (Nuclear Mode cannot be bypassed), Focus Score provides actionable data (not just a tree), Pomodoro built-in, scheduling, block page with motivation quotes, 10 free sites.
*Focus Mode Cons:* No virtual tree (gamification is score-based, not visual metaphor), no charity tie-in, no mobile app.

**Best For:**
- Forest: Users who want gentle motivation and enjoy the tree-growing metaphor, primarily mobile users
- Focus Mode: Users who need actual blocking enforcement, want data-driven productivity insights, and work primarily on desktop/laptop

**Verdict/Recommendation:** Forest is delightful but it is a motivation app, not a blocking app. If you can resist the temptation to close a tab and kill a virtual tree, Forest will not help you. Focus Mode - Blocker provides real enforcement with Nuclear Mode plus meaningful productivity data with Focus Score. If you are serious about eliminating distractions, Focus Mode is the tool that actually works.

**Word Count:** 2,200 | **CTA:** "Real blocking, real results" + CWS install button

**Month 4: Onboarding & Retention**

| Test ID | Element | Variant A (Control) | Variant B | Hypothesis | Primary Metric | Sample Size | Duration |

| T6.2 | Lifetime Offer Placement | Show on pricing page alongside monthly/annual | Show only after 30 days of Pro subscription ("Exclusive: lock in lifetime access") | Delayed lifetime offer converts loyal users at higher rate and increases LTV | Lifetime purchase rate | 100 eligible users per variant | 60 days |

#### Statistical Significance Requirements

| Parameter | Requirement | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Minimum sample per variant | 1,000 (CWS listing tests) / 300 (in-extension tests) | Sufficient power for 5% MDE |
| Confidence level | 95% (p < 0.05) | Industry standard for product decisions |
| Minimum detectable effect (MDE) | 5% relative improvement (CWS) / 10% relative (in-extension) | Below 5% is noise; in-extension has smaller samples so higher MDE |
| Test duration minimum | 14 days | Captures weekday/weekend variation (2 full cycles) |
| Test duration maximum | 60 days | Prevent decision paralysis; ship and iterate |
| Segments to analyze | New users vs returning, source (organic vs referral), day of week | Ensure effect is consistent, not driven by one segment |
| Early stopping rule | Do NOT stop early. Run to minimum sample size regardless of interim results. | Peeking inflates false positive rate. |
| Rollout after winner | 50% for 3 days, then 100% | Catch unexpected issues at partial rollout |

#### A/B Testing Tooling

| Test Type | Tool | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| CWS listing (title, description, screenshots) | Chrome Web Store A/B testing (if available) or time-based alternation | CWS has limited native A/B testing; may need to use sequential testing |
| In-extension (paywall, onboarding) | Custom feature flag system in extension | Simple flag system: `chrome.storage.local` with user cohort assignment |
| Pricing page (plan emphasis, display) | Custom implementation | Assign cohort at install time, persist in storage |
| Statistical analysis | Google Sheets calculator or Evan Miller's tool (evanmiller.org/ab-testing) | Do not build custom stats; use validated calculators |

### 4. Competitive Intelligence Framework

#### Weekly Monitoring Checklist

**For each competitor (BlockSite, StayFocusd, LeechBlock NG, Freedom, Forest, Cold Turkey):**

- [ ] **Version check:** Visit CWS listing, note version number and last updated date
- [ ] **Rating check:** Record current average rating and total review count
- [ ] **User count check:** Note "users" count displayed on CWS listing (record in spreadsheet)
- [ ] **Pricing check:** Visit pricing page (if applicable), note any changes
- [ ] **New features check:** Read latest changelog/release notes
- [ ] **Review scan:** Read 5 most recent negative reviews (1-2 star), note recurring complaints
- [ ] **Social mention scan:** Quick search on Twitter/X and Reddit for competitor name + "problem" or "alternative"

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes per week (automate where possible)

#### Competitor Tracking Spreadsheet Schema

```
Date | Competitor | Version | Last Updated | Rating | Reviews (Total) | Users | Price (Monthly) | Price (Annual) | New Features | Notable Negative Reviews | Our Opportunity
```

Update every Monday. Plot trends monthly.

#### Competitive Response Playbook

| Competitor Action | Detection Method | Response Timeline | Our Response | Do NOT Do |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Competitor drops price | Weekly pricing check | Within 1 week | Emphasize our free tier generosity (10 sites vs their limits). Highlight total value (blocking + Pomodoro + Focus Score + streaks). If asked, say "We compete on value, not price." | Do NOT match price. Price war destroys margins. |
| Competitor adds feature we already have | Version/changelog check | Within 3 days | Publish blog post or social post: "We've had [feature] since launch! Here's how our implementation works..." with demo. Update comparison articles. | Do NOT disparage their version. Show ours is mature. |
| Competitor adds feature we lack | Version/changelog check | Within 2 weeks (assess) | Evaluate if feature aligns with our roadmap. If yes, prioritize. If no, articulate why we chose differently. Update comparison articles to address. | Do NOT rush to copy. Do NOT pretend it is not useful if it is. |
| Competitor gets wave of bad reviews | Weekly review scan | Within 1 week | Create targeted content: "Looking for a [Competitor] alternative?" blog post. Answer Reddit/Quora questions from disappointed users. Run targeted search ads on "[competitor] alternative" keyword. | Do NOT celebrate their failure publicly. Do NOT badmouth them. |
| Competitor gets acquired or shuts down | News monitoring | Within 48 hours | Create migration guide: "Switching from [Competitor] to Focus Mode." Post on relevant communities. Update all comparison content. | Do NOT gloat. Be helpful to displaced users. |
| New competitor enters market | CWS monitoring, Google Alerts | Within 2 weeks | Analyze their angle and differentiation. Shore up any areas where they are notably better. Update "best of" content to include them (shows confidence). | Do NOT ignore them. Do NOT panic. |
| Competitor launches viral marketing campaign | Social monitoring | Within 1 week | Analyze what is working for them. Consider similar (not identical) approach. Increase our content output that week. Ensure our CWS listing is optimized to capture spillover interest. | Do NOT copy their campaign. Do NOT respond aggressively. |
| Competitor files CWS policy violation against us | CWS developer dashboard notification | Within 24 hours | Review our listing for any actual violations. Fix immediately if found. If baseless, respond calmly to CWS review team with evidence. | Do NOT retaliate with counter-reports unless genuinely warranted. |

**Quarterly Compliance Audit Checklist:**

- [ ] Review latest CWS policy updates (developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies)
- [ ] Verify all permissions are still necessary and justified
- [ ] Review privacy practices tab for accuracy
- [ ] Check that description matches actual functionality
- [ ] Ensure review prompt does not incentivize positive reviews
- [ ] Verify no third-party code has been added without disclosure
- [ ] Check that all screenshots accurately represent current extension
- [ ] Review competitor CWS violations for awareness (do NOT report frivolously)
- [ ] Confirm content security policy is current
- [ ] Test that uninstall survey (if any) complies with policies

#### Copycat/Clone Detection Process

**Monthly Clone Scan (15 minutes):**

1. Search Chrome Web Store for:
   - "Focus Mode" (check for name-squatting)
   - "Focus Mode Blocker" (exact match attempts)
   - "Focus Score website blocker" (feature copying with our terminology)
   - "Zovo" (brand name theft)

2. Search GitHub for:
   - Forks of our repository that have been republished as separate extensions
   - Projects using "Focus Score" terminology or identical UI elements

3. If clone detected:
   - Screenshot the clone listing immediately (evidence)
   - Document feature overlap and any copied assets (icons, screenshots, descriptions)
   - File CWS policy violation report if they violate our intellectual property
   - If they forked our open-source code: check if they comply with our license terms
   - Consider if their existence warrants accelerating any of our roadmap items

**Automated Alerts:**
- Google Alert: "Focus Mode Blocker" -site:zovo.one -site:github.com/theluckystrike
- Google Alert: "Focus Score chrome extension" -site:zovo.one
- CWS search alert (manual check): "focus mode" in productivity category
